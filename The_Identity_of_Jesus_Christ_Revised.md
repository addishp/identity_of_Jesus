Foreword

An unprecedented hunger for more of God
swept through Ethiopia in the early sixties, and He
graciously poured His Spirit on forty thousand of
those seeking Him with a deep, earnest thirsting for
righteousness. One of them,Teklemariam Gezahegn,
was mightily baptized with the Holy Ghost in 1964.
But the strong leadership that was desperately
needed did not develop, and as the number of Spirit
filled people reached over fifty thousand, vicious
strife, error, and carnality flawed what God had done.

Against the backdrop of human failure, Tekle.
sought the Lord with consistent urgency. While
fasting and praying in a cave he had a terrifying
vision of hell followed by an enthralling glimpse of
the New Jerusalem and the deliverance of the
righteous. He cried, “O Jesus, | beg You to reveal
Your whole truth to me.”

The glorious revelation he longed for did not
appear instantly. It came as the prophet predicted,
“precept upon precept; line upon line” (Isaiah 28:10).
In time, the Jehovah of the Old Testament revealed
Himself to Tekle as Jesus to redeem him. He also

showed Tekle the necessity of receiving’ His Spirit

baptized in the name of Jesus for the remission of
sins. This son of a farmer has since become an in-
spired champion for the truth unequaled since the
days of the Apostle Paul.

Today in Ethiopia, Tekle and his dedicated wife,
Erkenesh, lead the greatest revival of modern
missionary annals against unbelievable odds. A
recent conference witnessed by Reverend Harry
Scism, director of foreign missions for the United
Pentecostal Church produced this exclamation: “One
has to see this to believe it!”

Preface

And no one knows the Son except the Father,
Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son,
and he to whom the Son wills to reveal him (Matthew
11:27, NKJV).

The purpose of this book is to set forth the
true doctrine of Jesus Christ, which is the foundation
of the apostles and the prophets. Thousands of
denominations of the Christian religion have been
introduced into the world, each preaching its own
doctrine of salvation. The reason behind such an ap-
palling division is a failure to understand fully who
Jesus actually is. The articles of faith and books of
these sects demonstrate this problem.

These continued divisions have fulfilled the
words of the Apostle Paul: “For if he who comes
preaches another Jesus whom we have not
preached, or if you receive a different spirit which
you have not received, or a different gospel which
you have not accepted, you may well put up with
it.” (II Corinthians 11:4, NKJV).

Not knowing who Jesus is means being yoked
under the bondage of sin. It is then a very urgent
need and obligation to understand who Jesus is for
the sake of our salvation.

| believe and pray that this small book will
help the reader to understand fully the essence of
Jesus. It is certain that when Jesus is revealed the
second time, those who have based their doctrine of
Jesus on vain philosophy will be robed in shame,
while those who have understood and worshiped
Him according to the teachings of the Bible will be
glorified. Indeed, it is urgent that every soul come to
know the truth founded on the teaching of the apos-
tles and prophets in order to escape from judgment.

| therefore ask you to study this book with
Prayer, patience, and understanding so as to attain
the knowledge of Jesus Christ our Lord.
May God bless you!

The Only True God

The Deity has from eternity been one in entity,
character, and being never two or three. He has
manifested Himself to His people as the invisible Fa-
ther, in the visible Son, and as the Holy Spirit in the
hearts of believers. The conscience of every human
being witnesses that the one and only God has
existed from eternity in full divine essence, that He
will continue to exist forever, and that there is no
other God beside Him. This truth has been confirmed
by God's own testimony (Isaiah 44:24).

God the Father is at the same time Word and
Spirit. He accomplished creation by His Word, and
by His own breath. He gives life to the creation (Job
32:8; 33:4; Psalm 33:5-6; John 1:1-3).

God does not beget gods, nor does God repro-
duce Himself. There remains one divine essence
from eternity to eternity (Exodus15:11; Isaiah 9:6; 44:6-
8; 45:5-7; 48:12: Hebrew 13:8).

Some wrongly believe that the Word of God is
a second divine person that owes existence to the
Father. Likewise, they declare that the Spirit of God—
the Holy Spirit is a third divine person, with the Father
being the source of that person's existence. Hence,
they teach that there are three divine persons or enti-

ties making up the Godhead. They maintain that the
«Only One True God being one consists of three
separate but co-equal divine ‘entities bearing three
distinct names. Based on this conception, they con-
‘clude that these persons are one and three at the
same time.

Some of them attempt to justify this doctrine
by the three beings who appeared to Abraham in
Genesis 18. But we learn in Chapter 19 that they
were angels. Continuing the story, Genesis 19:1
reads, “Now the two angels came to Sodom in the
evening,” and verse 12 says, “Then the men said to
Lot” (NKJV). In verse 13 these angels plainly
declared, “And the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.”
All these texts show that the men who appeared to
Abraham were angels. God, on the other hand,
appeared to Abraham in a vision in Genesis 18:1.

To avoid the misconception of a plurality in
the Godhead, God spoke through Isaiah, “I, even |,
am the LORD,. and beside me there is no sav-
iour” (Isaiah 43:11). And in Isaiah 44:24 He de-
clared, “Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and He
that formed thee from the womb, | am the LORD that
maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens
alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself.

Therefore, we see that the doctrine of the
Trinity is contrary to the Scriptures. The Word of
God, which became flesh, is God in revelation and
the Spirit, or breath, of God is God in spiritual action.
(In both Hebrew and Greek, the same word is used |

for spirit and breath.) But the Word of God and the
Spirit of God cannot be separate divine persons.
When God was manifested in the flesh, He was still
one being, and He still possessed one name.

This truth is evident from Genesis 1:26-27.
"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after
our likeness... So God created man in his own
image, in the image of God created He him.” The
phrases “and God said,” “created man in his own
image,” and “in the image of God created He him”
are indicative of that God is only one. The fact that
the Only One True God is shown by the creation of
Adam as one being possessing only one personality,
one image, and one name. Man has no excuse if he
denies the essential the Only One True God, for God
has created him in His own image.

In the beginning, God was not known by the
titles Father, Son, and Holy Ghost as if they repre-
sented three distinct persons. There was not a single
time through the ages when God declared that there
was other co-equal divine entities with Him. On the
contrary, He has always been so jealous of His Only
One True God that He has told us many times never
to compare Him with any others.

No one can continue in life if his word and
breath are taken out of him. Likewise, God is not
God if His Word and Spirit are separated from Him.
The Deity is one God who cannot be separated or
disintegrated. A person does not change as he
speaks his word, nor does he get short of words.

Neither does he lose life because he breathes out
-now and then. Likewise, God did not get smaller or
suffer shortage when He, by His Word, created the
world, nor did He become short of breath when He
gave the breath of life to humanity. His Word and
His spirit do not at all change, reduce, or put an end
to His deity. In order to fulfill His promise to Eve in
Genesis 3:15, God the Father manifested in His Son,
that is, in flesh begotten of the Virgin Mary. Thus the
prophecy of Psalm 2:7 was fulfilled: “Thou art my
Son; this day have | begotten thee.”

How was the Son born? Nothing is impossible
with God. The Word of life, which was the essence
of God the Father, was made flesh in the womb of
Mary by the work of the Holy Spirit, by the power of
the- Most High. Thus Jesus was born as the only
begotten Son of God. The Word was made flesh,
that is, God was revealed to us in flesh (1Cor.15:46-
49,1Tim.3:16.)

God who was invisible and unapproachable
because of His divine essence now became both
visible and approachable by manifesting Himself
through His express image of flesh.

Can we then say that a second God was
born? By no means. We should rather say that the
holy Son of God was born. Why the Son of God?
Because the flesh was from the first prepared and
begotten of the Deity. God prepared Him and begat
Him by His Spirit, so the Son is the manifestation of
God's nature. Let us be clear that when the Son was

9

<!-- Page 14 -->

The Only True God

begotten of the Father through the Virgin Mary, He
was begotten for the very first time, not for the
second time. The Son is the word made heavenly
flesh body to serve as the dwelling of the only invisi-
ble Deity. The Father is manifested in Him; thus the
Son is “the brightness of His glory” and “the express
image of his person” (Hebrews 1:1-3). (See II Corin-
thians 4:4; Colossians 1:15.) Hence, He is the Son
of the Father.

Viewing His manifestation in heavenly flesh
alone, the Son is less than the Father. Thus He
said, “My Father is greater than |” (John 14:28) and “I
came forth from the Father, and am come into the
world: again, | leave the world, and go to the Fa-
ther” (John 16:28). Since God is manifest in the
Son, however, the Son is much greater and more
honorable than angels and human beings.
“Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and
given him a name which is above every name: that
at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of
things in heaven, and things in earth, and things un-
der the earth” (Philippians 2:9-10). (See Isaiah
52:53; Luke 1:35).

Our God, who possesses only one essence,
was manifested in the flesh without changing or do-
ing away with His divine essence. After the birth of
our Lord Jesus Christ, our one God worked among
men as the Father, in the Son, and as the Holy Spirit
at the same time.

The Identity of Jesus Christ

Jesus Christ declared. “All things are deliv-
ered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the
Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the
Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the
Son will reveal him” (Matthew 11:27). By this state-
ment, He made it evident that the identity of the Fa-
ther and the Son remains a great mystery to angels
and humans alike unless He reveals Himself to
them. When He revealed Himself to His apostles
they became bold enough to say, “That which was
from the beginning, which we have heard, which we
have seen with our eyes, which we have looked
upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of
life; (for the life was manifested and we have seen it,
and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal
life, which was with the Father, and was manifested
unto us;) that which we have seen and heard de-
clared we unto you” (1John1:1-3). (See Matt 13:11.)

John 1:1-4,14 says, “In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
was God. The same was in the beginning with God.
All things were. made by Him; and without Him was
not any thing made that was made. In Him was life;
and the life was the light of men...And the Word was
made flesh, and dwelt among us.” According to this
passage of Scriptures, the essence of God the
Father is the Word and the breath of life. .

Psalm 33:5-6 states, “The earth is full of the
goodness of the LORD. By the word of the LORD
were the heavens made; and all the host of them by

11

the breath of his mouth.” Here we are assured that
God the Father alone created all creation with the
words of His own-command, and that He made all
living creatures by the breath of His mouth.

God is not limited to any location. He fills
every part of the universe. Heaven and earth cannot
hold Him, and there is no one comparable to Him.
David wrote of the extent of His omnipresence,
“Whither shall | go from thy spirit? Or whither shall |
flee from thy presence? If | ascend up into heaven,
thou art there; if | make my bed in hell, behold, thou
art there; if | take the wings of the morning, and dwell
in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall thy
hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold
me” (Psalm 139:7-10).

By instructing us to pray, “Our Father which
art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done” (Matthew 6:9-10), the Lord
assured us that there is only one everlasting Father,
that He has only one kingdom, one will, and one holy
name. The Bible clearly states that there are many
gods in the world, but we acknowledge only one God
and Father who alone is from eternity and lives for-
ever (Isaiah 44:8, 24; 46:8-10; 1Corinthians 8:4-6;
1Timothy 1:17). He created everything alone, and
there is no other comparable unto him. (See Deuter-
onomy 32:39; Isaiah 43:3, 10-13; 44:6-8, 24).
Just as Moses testified that there is no other God like
Jehovah, we too must declare, "There is no other
God like You." (See Exodus 8:10; 15:11; Deut. 33:26.)

King David for his part witnessed of the great-
ness of our only God by saying, "Therefore You are
great, 0 LORD God. For there is none like You, nor
is there any God besides You, according to all that
we have heard with our ears" (Il Samuel 7:22,
NKJV). Again in Psalm 89:6-9, he asked rhetorically,
"For who in the heavens can be compared to the
LORD? Who among the sons of the mighty can be
likened to the LORD? God is greatly to be feared in
the assembly of the saints, and to be held in rever-
ence by all those who are around Him. O LORD God
of hosts, who is mighty like You, O LORD? Your
faithfulness also surrounds You. You rule the raging
of the sea; waves rise, You still them” (NKJV). (See
| Chronicles 17:20; Matthew 8:23-27.) Likewise, King
Solomon affirmed, "LORD God of Israel, there is no
God in heaven above or on earth below like You,
who keep Your covenant and mercy with Your
servants who walk before You with all their
heart" (I Kings 8:23, NKJV).

Jesus, too, taught that there is only one God,
and that there is no other beside Him (Mark 12:29-
31). Who is comparable to God in heaven? No one!
From John 1:1-14 we learn that our God, Jesus
Christ, is the light who shines on all mankind. He is
One who both created the world and came into it, but
whom the world knew not. The name of our God is
Jesus, and there is no other God than Him.

Jude, the brother of James, wrote in his epistle,
"For there are certain men crept in unawares, who

13

<!-- Page 18 -->

The Only True God

“were before of old ordained to this condemnation,
ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into las-
civiousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our
Lord Jesus Christ. . .To the only wise God our Sav-
iour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power,
both now and ever. Amen" (Jude 4, 25). He made
clear for us that some who deny the only one true
God creep into the church unawares. ;

The great Apostle Paul also taught that Jesus is
the only God with none comparable to Him: "Now
unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only
wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever.
Amen" (I Timothy 1:17). (See Romans 9:5; Galatians
3:20; | Timothy 2:5; 3:16.)

Therefore we should unite with Nehemiah in pro-
claiming, "Blessed be thy glorious name, which is
exalted above all blessing and praise. Thou, even
thou, art LORD alone; thou has made heaven, the
heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and
all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is
therein, and thou preservest them all; and the, host of
heaven worshippeth thee” (Nehemiah 9:5-6)

God Is Invisible \

\

God's divine essence has no visible or\tactile fig-
ure like that of a human being. Instead, it is written
in John 4:24, "God is a Spirit: and they that worship
him must worship him in spirit and in truth." And a
spirit hath neither flesh nor bones, as we learn from
Luke 24:39. Zophar asked, "Canst thou by searching
find out God? canst thou find out the almiahty unto
perfection?" (Job 11:7).

Job described the invisibility of God in a very
intéresting way: "La, he goeth by me, and | see him
not: he passeth on also, but | perceive him not" (Job
9:11). Similarly, Job 23:8-9 says, "Behold, | go
forward, but he is not there; and backward, but |
cannot perceive him: on the left hand, where he
doth work, but | cannot behold him: he| hideth
himself on the right hand, that | cannot see hii

Moses warned the Israelites in Deuteronomy
4:12-19 not to engrave the Lord God in any shape
whatsoever, as He bears no distinct figure. (See |
Timothy 1:17.) Indeed, there has been no person in
any period of time who saw or physically touched the
Spirit of God (John 1:18). Rather, we read in Acts
7:48-49, "Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in tem-
ples made with hands; as saith the prophet, Heaven

15

The Identity of Jesus Christ

is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house
will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place
of my rest?" From this passage of Scripture we learn
that God cannot be limited to length, breadth, and
height. (See also Isaiah 66:1-2; Jeremiah 23:24;
Acts 17:24.) And King Solomon acknowledged, "But
will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, the
heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain
thee" (I Kings 8:27). (See Il Chronicles 2:6.)

God is not confined to any certain place physi-
cally. He is Spirit, filling all the heavens, the earth,
under the earth, and even’ beyond hell
(Psalm139:7-12).

Yet many are misled by the story of the three
angels who came to Abraham in Genesis 18 and be-
lieve that God is a trinity constituting three co-equal,
co-existing, and co-eternal divine persons. Church
history tells us that the 318 theologians assembled in
Nicaea in A.D. 325 voted in support of the doctrine of
co-equality of the Father and Son, and the Council of
Constantinople in A.D. 381 adopted the doctrine of
the Trinity. Henceforth it is widely believed among
many people. Trinitarians further teach that these
three "divine persons" bear their own name. Thus
they teach that the titles Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
are their respective eternal names. Many Trinitarians
have also ratified the representation of each of these
three so-called divine persons in definite figures, in-
dicating that each of the three has some type of
separate, individual forms.

God Is Invisible

Nevertheless, as we have already seen, the
men who came to Abraham were not gods, but an--
gels. In fact, there was not a single time in the days
of the Old Testament when people saw God in His
divine spiritual essence. Instead, He made angels
bear His name and spoke to men through them
(Exodus 23:20-23). Our God, who cannot lie, has as-
sured us of His invisibility in Exodus 33:20: "You
cannot see My face; for no man shall see Me, and
live" (NKJV). True, Moses was privileged to see the
brightness of the glory of God; Abraham to see him
in a vision, and Ezekiel, Isaiah, and other prophets to
hear his voice and receive His blessings. Yet they
never saw His spiritual essence with their human
eyes face to face.

It is true that Jacob spoke of seeing the Lord
God face to face (Genesis 32:30). A thorough study
of the passage, however, makes it clea that he
wrestled with the angel of the Lord (Hosea 12:4).
And it was in a dream that Jacob saw the angels of
the Lord ascending and descending a ladder, and
the Lord standing above it. It is also true that men
like the priest and elders of Israel (Exo.24:9-11),
Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1-8), and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 1:1-28)
saw God. When we consider texts such as Exodus
33:20, Deuteronomy 4:12-19, and John 1:18,
however, we realize that they must have seen Him in
visions and not face to face, for these verses affirm
that no one can see, and has never seen, God face
to face.

The Identity of Jesus Christ

Daniel saw in a vision one like the Son of man
_ hundreds of years before Christ was born. He
witnessed, “I saw in the night visions, and, behold,
one like the Son of man came with the clouds of
heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they
brought him near before him" (Daniel 7:13). Like
Daniel, the other prophets who saw God in visions
apparently saw a form by which God manifested
Himself. Nevertheless, the Scriptures repeatedly at-
test that no one can see or has ever seen God, for
He is Spirit-invisible and intangible.

Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are therefore
simply descriptive terms of the invisible God, and not
names of three divine figures. As Father, God exists
from eternity. To save mankind, He was manifested
in the flesh His Word was made flesh. Thus Jesus
Christ was Emmanuel, the one God. The flesh was
the Son. The Son was life-giving flesh because of
the Father (deity) in Him (John 6:57).

The title of Holy Spirit refers to the One God
Himself, who is Spirit (John 4:24). It refers to God in
spiritual action. Therefore we can say that the Holy
Spirit is the breath of the Father that imparts life
(Genesis 2:7; Job 32:8; 33:4; John 20:22). God gives
a portion of His Spirit (holy breath) to us. The Bible
says that God pours out His Spirit, thus showing that
the Holy Spirit is not a separate person from God.

Therefore, the..One God has revealed Himself
in three different ways-as Father, Word (the Son),
and Holy Spirit. He is the indivisible, only God and

18

---

<!-- Page 23 -->

God Is Invisible

Father of all creation. He counsels with Himself in’
carrying out every plan and thought (Ephesians
1:11). He created everything by His Word, and by
His holy breath. He imparts life to everyone and re-
news and sanctifies the lives of His people. Yes, God
has the only divine essence. He is one Spirit, invisi-
ble, and intangible, possessing no figure that the
human eye can see.

There is Only One True God and not a second
or third person with equal divine status or nature.
The doctrine that the Word and Spirit of the Father
are distinct persons is un scriptural and false. In the
beginning the Father brought all creation into
existence by His Word and imparted life by His Spirit.
But if we make the Word and Spirit independent
gods, then we have teo many gods. Our God has
one indivisible and invisible Spirit.

The Invisible God
and His Angels

According to Isaiah 37:16 and 44:24, God had
no assistant during the six days of creation. Nev-
ertheless, he apparently did not choose privacy
while creating man; at least, it was no secret affair,
for it seems that He did it in the presence of His
angels. They are His witness that He created eve-
rything alone. Indeed, the phrase "God said" in
Genesis 1 repeatedly indicates that He created
everything by Himself. And the phrase "Let us
make man after our own image" shows that God
counseled with Himself, thus signifying His su-
premacy over all things. Not one angel assisted
God in His work of creation; therefore the design
and perfect harmony of creation remains beyond
their understanding. Instead, Ephesians 1:11 viv-
idly confirms that the Father has the ability to hold
counsel with His own will: "Being predestinated ac-
cording to the purpose of him who worketh all
things after the counsel of his own will."

Let us further consider Genesis 3:22: "And the
LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as

20

<!-- Page 25 -->

The Identity of Jesus Christ

one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he
put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life,
and eat, and live for ever ..." Apparently, God was
talking to His angels, who knew good and evil. The
next verse shows the reasonableness of this as-
sumption: "Therefore the LORD God sent him forth
from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from
whence he was taken. So he drove out the man;
and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden
Cherubims and a flaming sword which turned
every way, to keep the way of the tree of
life" (Genesis 3:23-24). Certainly, the cherubim
distinguish well between good and evil. Now that
Adam was able to distinguish between good and
-evil because of the tree he ate from, he had at-
tained the level of the cherubim in that respect. So
when God used the phrase, "the man is become
as one of us," He took into account the cherubim
together with Himself, but He did not pluralize Him-
self.

In Genesis 11:7 when God said, "Let us go.
down ... " He did not refer to other gods besides
Himself. The phrase "and the LORD came down"
in verse 5 makes clear that only One God acted.
Verses 8 and 9 further demonstrate this point,
saying, "The LORD scattered them."

Angels such as cherubim and seraphim have
always been in His company whenever God set
out to do anything.

The Invisible God and His Angels

The story in Genesis 18 is again worth men-
tioning for a comprehensive understanding of the
issue. When God appeared to Abraham in a vi-
sion, there also came angels to Abraham, and he
received them in his house. The angels came in
human form, they ate and drank, and they had
their feet washed. But God, as invisible Spirit, nei-
ther ate nor drank, nor had His feet washed. "No
one hath seen God, at any time" (John 1:18).
Again, while two angels headed toward Sodom
and Gomorrah to destroy them, God remained
with Abraham in the vision. The two angels were
received in Lot's house, where they ate and drank,
and on the following day they destroyed the two
cities with fire and brimestone according to the
commandment of the Lord. Actually, we read that
it was God who sent the fire and brimstone from
heaven, yet He used the angels as instruments of
the intended destruction (Genesis 19:24-25). Thus
angels are but the messengers and agents of
God. (See also Genesis 19:13; Exodus 23:20-25;
Hebrews 13:2.)

The all-knowing, almighty, perfect God needs
no counselor and never had one. "Who hath di-
rected the Spirit of the LORD, or being his coun-
sellor hath taught him? With whom took he coun-
sel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the
path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and
shewed to him the way of understand-ing?" (Isaiah

40:13-14). Indeed, God did and does everything
alone. Angels play only the part of messengers in
executing His plans. He never seeks their coun-
selor that of anyone.

_Mosés, Isaiah, and Ezekiel witnessed in their
visions that God is encircled by wonderful angels
and that He is full of glory and majesty. They
indicated that the angels appeared to them in
human like form. Ezekiel's vision is a good exam-
ple: "And the hand of the LORD was there upon
him. And | looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came
out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding
itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the
midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the
midst of the fire. Also out of the midst thereof
came the likeness of four living creatures. And this
was their appearance; they had the likeness of a
man" (Ezekiel 1:3-5).

The tabernacle made by the prophet Moses
was the shadow of heavenly reality (Hebrews 8:5).
The two cherubim standing on the mercy seat just
over the ark, which represented God's presence,
indicated that God has angelic servants to attend
Him. This is what Isaiah saw about God in his vi-
sion (Exodus 25:8-22; Isaiah 6:1-3).

Isaiah recorded his vision of God like this: "In
the year that King Uzziah died | saw also the Lord
sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his
train filled the temple. Above it, stood the

seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he

_ covered his face, and with twain he covered his
feet, and with twain he did fly. And one cried unto
another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of
hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. And the
posts of the door moved as the voice of him that
cried, and the house was filled with smoke. Then
said |, Woe is me! for | am undone, because | am
a man of unclean lips, and | dwell in the midst of a
people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen
the King, the LORD of hosts (lsa.6:1-5).

In his vision, Isaiah saw only One God, not
two or three gods bearing human figures. And this
God "seen" by both Isaiah and Ezekiel is sur-
rounded by angels and is King of Kings. The an-
gels do not give Him counsel; God simply uses
them to execute His plans. For instance, the Lord
cleansed Isaiah by sending one of His angels to
touch his lips with a live coal from the altar.

Just before sending Isaiah (the Lord knew
beforehand that He would be sending Isaiah), God
asked, "Whom shall | send, and who will go for
us?" (isaiah 6:8). The question "Whom shall |
send?" shows that the sender is one -only true
God. And by saying, “Who will go for us?" God
showed that He did it in the presence of His sur-
rounding angels. They are always around Him,
singing praises of His holiness and majesty day
and night. God employed plurality here to indicate

24

that angels many times assist God in His work.
Nevertheless, this is not to say that they possess
any knowledge of which they can be proud, nor do
they have the ability to carry out any divine work of
themselves.

Genesis 28:10-17 records Jacob's dream in
which he saw angels descending to the earth and
ascending to heaven. They were serving God. On
another occasion, Jacob found himself wrestling
with an angel all night, desiring a blessing. The
angel finally pronounced, "Thy name shall be
called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince
hast thou power with God and with men, and hast
prevailed" (Genesis 32:28). We realize from the
angel's words that he came in the name of God.
Hence Jacob said that He saw God face to face
(Gen.32:30). Hosea 12:4 says that this appear-
ance of God to Jacob was by an angelic form.

It was again through an angel that God first
appeared to Moses (Exodus 3:2). When Moses
came to Horeb, the mountain of God, the angel of
the Lord appeared to him in a flaming fire out of
the midst of a bush. Of such an angel God said in
Exodus 23:20-21, "Behold, | send an Angel before
thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee
into the place whicn | have prepared. Beware of
him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he
will not pardon your transgressions: for my name
is in him."

The Invisible God and His Angels

God accomplished His work at that time by
putting His name in this angel, so that people’
could follow him. The angel represented the Lord
God to the extent that he could speak as the Lord.
Clearly, he received messages from God and
passed them on to the Israelites. The Lord put His
word in this angel and gave him power and au-
thority. Yet this power and authority was all deter-
mined by God's will; it was not the angel's own
power and authority. Angels are empowered by
God to fulfill His errands (Psalm 78:49; 103:20).

In Isaiah 44:24, God affirmed that there is no
one anywhere comparable unto Him: "! am the
LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth
the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the
earth by myself." This declaration does not deny
the existence of angels, for verse 26 speaks of
the servant of God and the messengers of God.
Angels are simply God's messengers, yet these
messengers cannot be God or be equal with God.
While God has angelic attendants, He is unique in
His divine nature. He alone is God, and there is
no one like Him.

Christ was Not an Angel

It is.evident that.there was an angel in the days

of the Old Testament (perhaps Michael or Gabriel)

_who delivered messages from God to the Israelites,

and he bore the name of God. Was this "angel of the

LORD" Christ as some teach? Let us analyze his ap-
pearance to Moses.

"Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in
law, the priest-of Midian: and he led the flock to the
back side of the desert, and came to the mountain of
God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the LORD ap-
peared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of
a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned
with fire, and the bush was not consumed. . .God
called unto him out of the midst of the bush . . .And
he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from
off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is
holy ground. Moreover he said, | am the God of thy
father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he
was afraid to look upon God. . .And Moses said unto
God, Behold, when | come unto the children of Is-
rael, and shall say unto them, The God of your fa-
thers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to
me, What is his name? what shall | say unto them?

27

The Identity of Jesus Christ

And God said unto Moses, | AM THAT | AM: and
he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of
Israel, | AM hath sent me unto you" (Exodus 3:1-6,
13-14).

The angel who spoke to Moses was visible
and had a distinct figure. God manifested Himself
to Moses and spoke to Moses through the angel.
Moses did not actually see the Spirit of God Him-
self, for no one has ever seen God (John 1:18).

God later promised to send an angel to lead
the Israelites and He invested His name in the an-
gel: "Behold; | send an Angel before thee, to keep
thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place
which | have prepared. Beware of him, and obey

- his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon
your transgressions: for my name is in
him" (Exodus 23:20-21). The invisible God used
the angel to guide the Israelites. (See also Gene-
sis 18-19; Judges 13.)

The archangel Michael is the angel who
stands watch over the people of Israel, and he will
help deliver them in the day of tribulation (Daniel
12:1). Followers of Charles Russell and of Ellen G.
White teach that Christ is Michael before or after
His birth from Mary. However, no scriptural evi-
dence can be found in either the Old or New Tes-
tament to support this theory. We only find that the
Word was made flesh, not that an angel was
clothed in or made flesh.

Christ was Not an Angel

The Book of Hebrews describes the mani-
festations of God in these words: "God who at
sundry times and indivers manners spake in time
past unto the fathers the prophets, hath in these
last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he
made the worlds; who being the brightness of his
glory, and the express image of his person, and
upholding all things by the word of his power,
when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down
on the right hand of the Majesty on high. Being
made so much better than the angels, as he hath
by inheritance obtained a more excellent name
than they. For unto which of the angels said he at
any time, Thou art my Son, this day have | begot-
ten thee? And again, | will be to him a Father, and
he shall be to me a Son?" (Hebrews 1:1-5). This
passage asserts that Christ was God's only begot-
ten Son, and not Michael or any other of God's an-
gels.

Itappears that Michael was appointed arch-
angel after the fall of Lucifer. How can we then say
that it was through Michael that God created the
world? Instead, we are told in the Scriptures that
God created the world through Christ (Hebrews
1:2). Can anyone dare say that Christ was ap-
pointed archangel after the fall of Lucifer? Was
Lucifer once above Christ before his fall? By no
means!

The Identity of Jesus Christ

If Christ is Michael, an angel, then we should

. not worship Him, for we are warned not to worship
angels: "Let no man beguile you of your reward in
a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels,
intruding into those things which he hath not seen,
vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind” (Colossians
2:18). But Christ is not at all an angel; rather, He
is worshiped by angels themselves: "And again,
when he bringeth in the first begotten into the
world, he saith, And let all the angels of God
worship him" (Hebrews 1:6). The word “all” in-
cludes Michael. Therefore, Christ cannot be Mi-
chael. All things in heaven, on earth, and under
the earth-even all angels-will kneel to the name of
Jesus, and every tongue will confess that Jesus

Chfist is Lord, to the glory of God (Philip. 2:9-11).

Colossians 2:9 states of Christ, "For in him
dwelleth the fulness of the. Godhead bodily." This
verse makes it clear that Christ is the manifesta-
tion of God, not another being apart from God's
own essence, as Michael is. And can Michael
boldly declare, "I and my Father are one"? No, he
cannot!

As to His deity, Jesus is the God of gods, the
Creator of all angels, as we learn from Isaiah 9:6:
"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
given . .his name shall be called Wonderful, Coun-
selor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father,
The Prince of Peace." If this verse describes

30

<!-- Page 35 -->

Christ was Not an Angel

- Michael (or one of the other angels), then it would
mean that Michael was eternal-uncreated. But it
clearly refers to Jesus. He is the mighty God and
the everlasting Father; therefore, He certainly cre-
ated Michael. Moreover, as to His manifestation
Jesus was born as a child and as the Son; He did
not borrow a body either from Michael or one of
the other angels. He "took not on him the nature of
angels; but he took on him the seed of Abra-
ham" (Hebrews 2:16). Instead, Christ is the mani-
festation of God, the Creator of all creation, un-
searchable by the wisdom of men, but the God of
all wisdom.

The Deity Cannot Be
Divided

Psalm 33:5-6 says, "The earth is full of the
goodness of the LORD. By the word of the LORD
were the heavens made; and all the hosts of them by
the breath of his mouth."

Some theologians of different sects have used
the above passage of Scripture to demonstrate their
theory of the Trinity. Consequently, they attempt to
split God's one essence into three separate persons,
pronouncing, “We believe in God the Father, God
the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.". They make the
bare identification:

. “The earth is full of the goodness of the

LORD” alludes to God the Father.

2. “By the word of the LORD were the heav-
ens made” points to God the Son.

3. “And all the hosts of them by the breath of his
mouth" represents God the Holy Spirit.
Hence, these theologians conclude, three di-
vine persons exist, each possessing individu-
ality and being co-equal in creative skill,
power, nature, and knowledge. This theory of
the Trinity was explained by the bishops
Abulidis and Severus as follows:

32

---

<!-- Page 37 -->

The Identity of Jesus Christ

"The Father in His particular person is heart,
and is the heart of the Son and the Holy Spirit. The
Son and the Holy Spirit have no heart, but the
Father. "The Son in His particular person is the
Word, and the Word of the Father and the Holy
Spirit. The Father and the Holy Spirit have no Word.
"And the Holy Spirit in His particular person is life,
and is the life of the Father and the Son. The Father
and the Son have no other life, but the Holy Spirit. .
"The Holy Trinity, therefore, exists from eternity,
thinking by the heart (the Father), speaking by the
Word (the Son), and living by the life of the Holy
Spirit." (Short History, Faith and Order of the Ethio-
pian Orthodox Tewahdo Church, Addis Ababa,
1983, pages 25-26).

A careful examination of the preceding definition
reveals to us that it contradicts its own concept of co-
equality. The three so-called "divine persons" are
each deprived of the full personality that "their"
image creature-man is endowed with individually.
Each human possesses body, soul, and spirit, thus
being a fullperson. But according to this trinitarian
definition, God the Son has neither heart nor life, God
the Father has neither word nor life, and God the
Holy Spirit has neither heart nor word. The co-
equality concept of these theologians is further un-
dermined as the Holy Spirit is the source of life to the
other two persons and has the most indispensable
part. For without first having life, the Father (the
heart) could not think, nor could the Son ( Word)

33

---

<!-- Page 38 -->

The Deity Cannot Be Divided

speak. Clearly, this dogma is illogical and unscrip-
tural.

If we carefully examine Psalm 33:5-6 itself, it
speaks of only one God and not three. This one God
has heart, word, and breath of life all by Himself. His
nature is not shared among three "divine persons." If
God the Father does not possess voice (word) and
life, He cannot be called God at all. He cannot
execute creation either. If God the Father does not
by Himself possess life, He cannot possess the
breath by which He made man a living soul.
Undoubtedly, God the Father can by Himself think,
talk, create, and act as He wills.

If God's word and breath are taken as separate
divine persons, then one could even be led to think
that the number of divine persons might exceed
three. For instance, could we assert that "the good-
ness of the LORD" mentioned in Psalm 33:5 is by
itself a separate god? God said in Isaiah 51:5, "My
righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth,
and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall
wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.” In
|saiah 53:1 the prophet petitions, "Who hath believed
our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD re-
vealed?” Can we then say that "righteousness,"
"salvation", and "arm" are persons of the Godhead?
They cannot be so.

If we follow this line of logic, many persons of the
Godhead could be left unmentioned. How should
we, for example, understand the statement that "the

34

---

The Identity of Jesus Christ

worlds were framed by the word of God" (Hebrews
11:3). If we do not understand the word here as the
simple utterance of command, should we take it that
a separate divine person known as the Word created
the heaven and the earth? Should we further
establish, based on Isaiah 48:13, that another person called
"my hand" formed the earth and a person called "my
right hand" spanned the heavens? Certainly not! We
should interpret the Scriptures with wisdom so as not
to mistake the various attributes and operations of
God-such as righteousness, salvation, and arms-as
individual gods themselves.

"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God. The same
was in the beginning with God. All things were made
by him; and without him was not any thing made that
was made" (John 1:1-3). Here, the Word refers to
the invisible and untouchable God who was mani-
fested in flesh. God, who is the Word, is the Creator
of all things. The everlasting Word did not have any
tangible form until the Son was born of Mary. If we
assert that one of the angels who appeared to Abra-
ham in Genesis 18 came to be born of Mary, then we
are saying that she gave birth to an angel. But the
Bible says she gave birth to a Son in whom dwelt the
fulness of God.

It is written in Psalm 107:20, "He sent his word,
and healed them, and delivered them from their
destruction.” This verse does not mean that the
Word was sent in the form of a visible body to heal:

35

---

<!-- Page 40 -->

The Deity Cannot Be Divided

‘the people, being another person. It simply means
that the Word of the invisible God-the Father healed
them and delivered them from destruction.

Again in Isaiah 55:11 we read, "So shall my word
be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return
unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which |
please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto | sent
it." This verse of Scripture clarifies that God's Word
emanates from God to accomplish God's will. It can-
not be taken to mean an independent person and be
called "God the Word"; if we use such a term we
should use it to refer to God the Father. At the same
time we must not call the Word of God in the Old and
New Testaments "God the Bible." Rather, it is the
written Word of God inspired by the Spirit of God.

The Word of John 1 is God in self-revelation, and
the Son is self manifestation in which God the Father
manifested Himself.*God cannot be separated from
His Word, for He is the word. God is indivisibly one.

The Spirit of God

Many teach that the Spirit of God is a sepa-
rate person of the Godhead. Consequently, they re-
fer to Him as "God the Holy Spirit" instead of as the
Spirit of God or the Holy Spirit. However, the title of
Holy Spirit refers to God the Father, for "God is a
Spirit; and they that worship Him must worship Him
in spirit and in truth" (John 4:24):

The Bible describes the Spirit of God as the
breath of God(See Genesis 2:7; Job 4:9; Psalm
33:5-6; Isaiah 11:1-4, John 20:22.) In fact, both the
Hebrew and Greek words for “Spirit” can also be
translated as "breath" or “wind”. Thus the Holy Spirit
is not another person or another god, but rather God
the Father in His life giving work.

God the Father pours out His Holy Spirit, His
Spirit not only makes His creatures alive but also
lives among or in them. The Spirit of the Father is
both limitless and endless. Accérding toJob 32:8,
"There is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the
Almighty giveth them understanding.” This verse
indicates that the Spirit of God is the breath of the
Father, and not a third god. Just as the world came
forth by the word of command "Let it be," so also is

37

---

<!-- Page 42 -->

The Identity of Jesus Christ

creation alive by the breath (Spirit) of God the
Father. The Word of God effected creation; it was
not uttered in vain. In the same way, the breath of
the same God did not come in vain, but imparted life
to Adam. God is the source of life: He pours out His
Spirit every passing moment, and His Spirit did not
cease working after breathing life into Adam.

God is not sustained by a life outside Himself,
that is, by a separate divine, life-giving agent. Job
33:4 says, "The Spirit of God hath made me, and the
breath of the Almighty hath given me life." This verse
testifies of the capability of God to create; it does not
tell us that God the Father uses another god or
divine person to create all things.

The Bible likens the Spirit of God to the wind and
describes the Spirit as filling people (John 3:8; Acts
2:1-4). The Spirit is also typified or symbolized in
Scripture by oil, a cloud, fire, and a dove. This does
not mean that the Spirit permanently takes the
shape of any of these images, however. Instead,
the Spirit of God is simply God in emanation or op-
eration. As the rays of the sun heat the earth but are
not a separate entity from the sun itself, so the Spirit
of God can anoint and fill us without being separated
from God's own essence and nature. Just as the rays
of the sun give us heat and light because of the sun
itself, so also does the Spirit of the Father give us life
because of the Father Himself.

If a person hides himself close to us in a dark
place, we can tell his presence because of his

38

---

<!-- Page 43 -->

The Spirit of God

breath. Similarly, we can feel God's presence
because He moves us or touches us with His Spirit.

Just as the sun, maintaining its being one for
ages, sends rays to the earth and yet is not divisible
in entity and nature, God has from eternity been
(and will continue to be for the rest of eternity) one in
essence, nature and name creating and sustaining
all things through His Word and Spirit.

39

<!-- Page 44 -->

God the Father and His
Manifestation in Christ

Many theologians teach that God exists as three
eternal, distinct persons:

1. God the Father, who is neither the Son nor the

Holy Spirit
2. The Son, who is neither the Father nor the
Holy Spirit

3. The Holy Spirit, who is neither the Father nor

the Son.

Consequently, they boldly believe in the exis-
tence of three distinct deities and attempt to spread
this doctrine widely. They conclude that the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit are equal in divinity but remain
in their respective positions and are not interchange-
able. Scripture verses cited by these theologians as
evidence for this doctrine include Genesis 1:26;
Psalm 33:5-6; Proverbs 30:4; Daniel 3:25; John 8:
16-19; and Acts 7:55. Yet all these iexts speak of
only One True God and not three.

In chapter 4 we described the doctrine formu-
lated by Abulidis and Severus concerning the Trinity
-the Father as heart of all the three, the Son as the
Word of all the three, and the Holy Spirit as the life of
all the three. But a close look into the nature of man,

40

---

<!-- Page 45 -->

The Identity of Jesus Christ

who was created after the likeness of God, gives us
insight into the nature of God himself. Man pos-.
sesses heart, word, and the breath of life in his one,
indivisible essence. Similarly, God's essence is also
complete and indivisible.

Another theologian named Athanathius taught:
"One of the three men who had appeared to Abra-
ham later dwelt in the womb of our Lady Virgin Mary
as an all-knowing and all-perceiving person. He
partook of her soul, flesh and blood into his own
nature. Thus, we speak of divine incarnation only
with God the Son and not with God the Father or the
Holy Spirit. We cannot say that, for neither the
Father nor the Holy Spirit entered into the womb of
the Virgin Mary to become man" (Haimanot-Abaw
(Amharic), page 36).

If "God the Son" came with a borrowed heart and
borrowed life into this world, then how were the
Father and the Holy Ghost able to continue in
existence? And how can the Son of God, in separa-
tion from the other two, be God on His own for that
matter? This doctrine is absolutely faliacious. There
are not two or three gods, but only One. The Bible
warns against people believing in and worshiping
two or more gods (Deut. 6:4-6; II Kings 17:19-41).

We read in Romans 9:5, "Whose are the fathers,
and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came,
who is over all, God blessed for ever." In this verse
we are assured that the God of the patriarchs such
as Abraham was manifested in flesh bearing the

41

<!-- Page 46 -->

“ God the Father and His Manifestation

name of Jesus Christ. He is the only God and
Savior. God the Father Himself confirms that He has
been revealed through His Son, that is, His flesh.
And He decided to feveal Himself by the name
Jesus, as Matthew 1:20-23 explains: "But while he
thought on these things, behold, the angel of the
Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph,
thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary
thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the
Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and
thou shalt call His name JESUS: for He shall save
His people from their sins. Now all this was done,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the
Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be
with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall
call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is,
God with us." ;

This passage of Scripture tells us that. the One
who came in the flesh is Emmanuel. In othér words,
Jesus is God the Father Himself in the flesh. God is
all-powerful; hence He was able to dwell among us
in the flesh. Perhaps the phrase "Will ye weary my
God also?" in Isaiah 7:13 indicated that God the Fa-
ther was going to be manifested in weak flesh. But
His coming in the weak body of flesh was only for
the sake of making us strong. He was not overcome
by weakness, for everything done to Him:in the flesh
was done for our sake, that He might redeem us.

Isaiah 9:6 declares, "For unto us a child is
born, unto us a Son is given: and the government

42

---

<!-- Page 47 -->

The Identity of Jesus Christ

shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
called Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The
Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." Here we
see clearly that the only God described as the
mighty God and the everlasting Father has been
manifested in the flesh. Although He took the like-
ness of a child, He is actually God the Father mani-
fested in heavenly flesh.

The Bible plainly witnesses that Jesus is truly
God, for "the Word was God" and "the Word was
made flesh" (John 1:1, 14). This statement does not
mean that God the Father was changed into
humanity, but rather that the Father was manifested
in the flesh. He was not created or transformed;
rather He (God) was among us. He came in a visible
and tactile form; He visited us bearing the flesh that
was made flesh in the likeness of a man.

There are not two mighty gods. There are not
two everlasting Fathers, either. There is only One
everlasting Father, who was manifested in the flesh
as the Son. Christ was born of Mary and was
revealed as the visible image of God. He is the Word
of the Father; He is revelation of God the Father in
flesh. "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt
among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of
the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and
truth. . .No man hath seen God at any time; the only
begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father,
he hath declared him" (John 1:14, 18). This passage
confirms that as to His body Christ is the Son of the

43

---

<!-- Page 48 -->

God the Father and His Manifestation

Father and through Him God the Father was mani-
- fested. Before the Word became flesh, God had no
visible or touchable figure. But in the days of the
New Testament, God came in flesh; thus through the
flesh God the Father was revealed to us in a visible,
touchable, life giving body. This event was accom-
plished in Jesus Christ.

John 1:9-10 states, "That was the true Light, which
lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He
was in the world, and the world was made by him,
and the received him not. But as many as received
him, to them gave he power to become the sons of
God, even to them that believe on his name [the
name of Jesus]." According to this passage, God,
the creator of the world, came to "his own" in the
flesh, bearing the mighty name of Jesus. However,
because "his own" did not realize who He was, they
did not receive Him. The Father, who was the Word
Himself, was manifested through Jesus Christ. The
Father did not change His divine essence into flesh
but he prepared a body (flesh) and who mani-
fested to carry the cross for us. (Hebrew10:5,
Colossians. 1:22)

We have already seen that God the Father is
at the same time Word and Spirit (John 1:1-14;
4:24). According, to John 1:1-14, the Word that from
the beginning was with God and was God became
flesh. The Word of life that was from the beginning
entered the womb of Mary. The child that was born
was manifested in heavenly flesh. (1Cor.15:47-49,

1Tim.3:16.), and He was the Father manifest. That is
why Christ is referred to as the Son of the Father.

The reason Jesus was:called Emmanuel, then,
is that God the Father was manifested to us in the
flesh; hence we saw and touched Him (I John 1:1-3;
3:1-5).

From the beginning, the Word was never a
separate person or entity outside the Father, for
John 1:1-3 states, "In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with God. All things
were made by him; and without him was not anything
made that was made." Here, It Is made clear that the
Word was God Himself. The Word is the mind of the
Father and the Father in self-revelation, not a second
deity outside the Father. The Bible teaches that we
have only One Creator, not two (Malachi 2:10).
When the Bible says that everything was created by
God's Word, it simply means that creation resulted
from the plan, thought, and utterance of God, not
through a so-called second God. Just as the word of
a man is inseparable from the man himself, so is the
Word of God inseparable from His divine essence.

Paul stated in Ephesians 3:8-9, "Unto me. . .is
this grace given, that | should preach among the
Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; and to
make all men see what is the fellowship of the
mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath
been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus
Christ." Here we are given the assurance that the

“God the Father and His Manifestation

Creator is God and that He created everything by
Jesus Christ. That is, He created everything with
Christ and the plan.of redemption in view. God has
only one di.ine nature and essence, and He needed
to put on heavenly flesh in order to save mankind.
And Jesus Christ is the One God who came in flesh.
He is the mystery that was hidden from the begin-
ning in God and is revealed now.

Colossians 1:15-16 says of Christ, "Who is the
image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
creature: for by him were all things created, that are
in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible,
whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principali-
ties, or powers: allthings were created by him and
for him." Christ is the visible image of the invisible
God the Father. The Word that from the beginning
had been the creative force was and is the Father
Himself and was manifest in Christ.

Hebrews 1:1-3 says, "God ... Hath in these last
days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath
appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made
the worlds; who being the brightness of his glory,
and the express image of his person ... " Again we
see that God created the world with the Son in view
and that Christ is the Word of God made flesh. He is
the self-revelation of God in His creative plan and
power. It is further clear that Christ was the express
image of God's person and the brightness of His
glory after becoming flesh as the Son of God.

The Identity of Jesus Christ

That is why in John 10:30 Jesus declared, "I and
-my Father are one." In other words, the Father ex-
isted in the Son by way of manifestation. Again in
John 10:38 Jesus reaffirmed His perfect unity with
and identity as God by saying to the Jews, "Though
ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may
know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and | in
him."

The Jews clung to their age-old belief that there
is Only One God and that there is none like Him, and
they refused to believe that Jesus was that One God
manifest. Thus they tried to seize Jesus and stone
Him. At that point He had himself from them and
escaped out of their hand. As God, He was able to
do so, for He was both God and Man.

We must disregard the false teaching of man that
"God the Son" or a second divinity was united with
the perfect humanity born of Mary. Instead we must
believe that God the Father was manifested in heav-
enly flesh in His begotten Son, which He prepared. in
the womb of the Virgin Mary (John 14:10; Il Corin-
thians 5:19).

Let us consider the discussion between Jesus
and the Pharisees in John 8:12-16: "Then spake
Jesus again unto them, saying | am the light of the
world: he that followeth me shall not walk in dark-
ness, but shall have the light of life. The Pharisees
therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thy-
self; thy record is not true. Jesus answered and said
unto them, Though | bear record of myself, yet my

47

---

<!-- Page 52 -->

God the Father and His Manifestation

record is true: for | know whence | came and whither
| go; but ye cannot tell whence | come, and whither |
go. Ye judge after the flesh; | judge no man. And yet
if | judge, my judgment is true: for | am not alone, but
| and the Father that sent me." In John 8:24-25
Jesus warned, "I said therefore unio you, that ye
shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that | am
he, ye shall die in your sins. Then said they unto
him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even
the same that | said unto you from the beginning."

By these statements Jesus told the Pharisees
that He was the same God who had spoken to them
ever since the days of the patriarchs and that He
was God the Father veiled in the flesh in the New
Testament days. Yet they would not accept Him. The
more Jesus revealed to the Jews His dual essence
as the Father and the Son, the more they were
stirred against Him, as we read in John 8:56-59:
"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and
he saw it, and was glad. Then said the Jews unto
him, thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou
seen Abraham? Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily |
say unto you, before Abraham was, | am. Then took
they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself,
and went out of the temple, going through the midst
of them and so passed by." If Jesus were only hu-
man, He would not have been able to hide Himself in
their very midst. If He were only God, they would not
have been able to see His presence in their midst,
for God is invisible. But this incident shows that Je-

48

---

<!-- Page 53 -->

The Identity of Jesus Christ

sus was perfect God manifested in His Heavenly
flesh, hence both the Father (deity) and the Son is
heavenly man.

Trinitarian theologians poninnionky believe that a
preexisting "God the Son" came into this world by
permission of the Father and the Holy Ghost and
took on humanity from Mary. We must disregard this
fallacious conception and hold fast to the testimony
Jesus gave of Himself, for His testimony is true. If we
carefully examine the Holy Scriptures, we will see
what He loudly declared about, His heavenly flesh
(His manifestation in flesh). Jesus cried and said,
"He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but
on him that sent me. And he that seeth me seeth him
that sent me" (John 12:44-45). In other words,
Jesus is the One God, the Father, manifest in all His
fulness (Colossians 2:9).

The manifastation of the Father in the Son is ex-
pressed by Jesus in John 14:7-11: "If ye had known
me, ye should have known my Father also: and from
henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. Philip
saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it
sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have | been so
long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me,
Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father;
and how sayest thou then, shew us the Father?
Believest thou not that | am in the Father, and the
Father in me? the words that | speak unto you |
speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in
me, he doeth the works. Believe me that | am in the

49

---

<!-- Page 54 -->

God the Father and His Manifestation

Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for
the very works' sake."

None of us can have a question more important
than that of Philip, and no better answer than that of
Jesus can be given. He explained that God the
Father is in the Son (deity manifested in the flesh)
and the Son is in the Father (God was in Christ
2Cor.5:19) in perfect manifestation, thus assuring
that God is Only One. Therefore, we should believe
and declare that Jesus Himself is God the Father in
the flesh. If we try to imagine Christ apart from God
the Father, then He will only become for us a human,
and if He be only human, He cannot heal and save
us. On the other hand, if we think of Him as a god
distinct from God the Father, then we are making
two independent gods. This, too, is a great abomina-
tion in the sight of the only God, who is God the
Father. Consequently, the judgment of Exodus 22:20
will come upon us: "He that sacrificeth unto any god,
save unto the LORD only, she shall be utterly
destroyed.

Jesus His fleshly body testified that It was His
deity, or the Father, working in Him, and not His
flesh (John 14:10-11).

The passages of Scriptures that follow provide
evidence that Jesus Christ is the only true God
manifested in flesh.

1.1 Timothy 1:15-17: "This is a faithful saying,

and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of

50

whom | am chief. Howbeit for this cause |
obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ
might show forth all longsuffering, for a pattern
to them which should hereafter believe on him
to life everlasting. Now unto the King eternal,
immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be
honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen."
For those who honestly seek for the truth from
the Word of God alone, the above passage vividly
declares that Jesus Christ is the only eternal and
invisible God robed in the flesh, and there is no other
God beside Him.

2. | Timothy 2:3-7: "For this is good and accept-
able in the sight of God our Saviour; who will
have all men to be saved, and to come unto the
knowledge of the truth. For there is One God,
and One mediator between God and men, the
man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom
for all, to be testified in due time. Whereunto |
am ordained a preacher, and an apostle,
(I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;)_ a
teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity."
Here, the apostle Paul taught us that Jesus

Christ our Savior is deity manifested in the heavenly
flesh (John 6:42-61). God (the Father) was
manifested in the flesh prepared by God Himself.
The flesh was made for us a mediator-Truth, Way,
Life, Door, and Light-to restore our relationship with
God. Thus we are complete in Him.

God the Father and His Manifestation

3. | Timothy 3:16 "Without controversy great is
the mystery of godliness: God was manifested
in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of
angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed
on in the world, received up into glory."

God was manifested in the flesh; He did not
actually become flesh. God revealed Himself to us
by robing Himself in heavenly flesh. That is why we
say Jesus Christ is both God and man (See also
Luke 1:35-37; John 1:1-14; Hebrews 1:1-3.) Due to
His manifestation the Almighty God, who had only
one divine nature, prepared a body and was
revealed in His flesh. In short, Jesus Christ was
both divine and heavenly man. And this mystery has
been revealed to the church to believe.

4. Colossians 2:9-10: ,"For in him dwelleth all
the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are
complete in him, which is the head of all
principality and power."

This passage clearly states that the Deity is fully
incorporated in the flesh, and not outside of it as a
separate person. Those who teach that Jesus Christ
is merely a man with a separate body, and not God
the Father, have no scriptural evidence. And those
who teach that Jesus Christ is a separate god or a
separate person independent of God the Father are-
not supported by Scripture either.

Moreover, the Spirit that dwelt in Jesus was
none other than the Holy Spirit, as shown by
John 20:22: "And when he [Jesus] had said this, he

52

---

<!-- Page 57 -->

The Identity of Jesus Christ

breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye
the Holy Ghost." The Bible also says, "Now the Lord
is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
there is liberty. But we all, with open face beholding
as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into
the same image from glory to glory, even as by the
Spirit of the Lord" (Il Corinthians 3:17-18). "But ye
are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the
Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not
the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his" (Romans 8:9).
These verses of Scripture attest that Christ is God
and also that the Holy Spirit (the Breath of God) is
the Spirit of Jesus Christ and flows from Him.

5. Jude 3-4: "Beloved, when | gave all diligence to
write unto you of the common salvation, it was
needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you
that ye should earnestly contend for the faith
which was once delivered unto the saints. For
there are certain men crept in unawares, who
were before of old: ordained to this con-
demnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of
our God into lasciviousness, and denying the
only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ."

This passage tells of the appearance of people
who divert falsely the teachings delivered once and
for all to the saints, particularly the Only One God
manifested in flesh. Thus Jude wrote with vividness
about the Only true God in verses 24-25: "Now unto
him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
present you faultless before the presence of his

53

<!-- Page 58 -->

« God the Father and His Manifestation

glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our
Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power,
both now and ever. Amen." Jesus is the only God
of power and dominion, glory and majesty from
eternity, now and forever.

6. Il Corinthians 5:19: "To wit, that God was in
Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not
imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
committed unto us the word of reconciliation."

God came in flesh to reconcile people to
Himself. Thus Jesus Christ is both our mediator and
the One to whom we are reconciled. In other words,
we humans are recon-ciled to God through the flesh
in which He came. God was manifested in the flesh
(made Himself Emmanuel "God with us") in order to
Save people from their sins and recon-cile them with
Himself. According to Acts 20:28, the blood of Christ
is itself the blood of God the Father: “Take heed
therefore unto yourself, and to all the flock, over the
which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to
feed the church of God, which he hath purchased
with his own blood."

7. John 3:13: "And no man hath ascended up
to heaven, but he that came down from heaven,
even the Son of man which is in heaven." This testi-
mony was given by Jesus Himself, the Word who
came from heaven. At this time He was on earth with
Nicodemus, robed in flesh, but in His deity He still
was, at that very moment, the omnipresent God.

8. Micah 5:2-4: "But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah,
though thou be little among the thousands of Judah,
yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to
be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been
from of old, from everlasting. Therefore will he give
them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath
brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall
return unto the children of Israel. And he shall stand
and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty
of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall
abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the
earth."

Christ was originally the Word (God). In the
fulness of time He came in the flesh as the only
begotten Son of God. The phrase "whose goings
forth have been from of old, from everlasting"
assures us that He was always God Himself, and not
a separate divine person. The phrase "in the majesty
of the name of the LORD his God" indicates that the
only begotten Son of God (born of Mary) was
a heavenly man. Therefore the name Jesus is the
name of the manifested Deity, or in other words, that
of God the Father. Thus Jesus could say in John
5:43, "| am come in my Father's name, and ye
receive me not."

We need to understand and believe that there
is only one true God manifested in flesh. “And this is
life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John
17:3). The divine manifestation in Christ is clearly

55

God the Father and His Manifestation

described in Matthew 1:23: "Behold, a virgin shal! be
with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall
call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is,
God with us." (See also Isaiah 7:14; 9:6.)

The flesh of Christ is the body in which God
dwelt, as John 2:19-22 discloses: "Jesus answered
and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three
days | will raise it up. Then said the Jews, Forty and
six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou
rear it up in three days? But he spake of the temple
of his body. When therefore he was risen from the
dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this
unto them, and they believed the scripture, and the
word which Jesus had said." As a man, Christ died
in the flesh (1Pet.3:18). He died on our behalf for
our sins, and God the Father raised Him from the
dead, setting Him on the right hand of His power to
become the head of the church. Since the Father
actually dwelt in the man Christ, Jesus could say,
“I will raise up my own body."

9. Jeremiah 23:5-6: "Behold, the days come,
saith the LORD, that | will raise unto David a right-
eous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper,
and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.
In his days Judah shail be saved, and Israel shall
dwell safely: this is his name whereby he shail be
called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS
[Jehovah-Tsidkenu]." According to the flesh Jesus
was the son of David, entitled to the throne of David.
Actually He came not for the short-lived earthly

kingdom of Israel over which David ruled, but to
establish an everlasting, heavenly kingdom of the
Israel of God and rule aver it eternally. At the same
time, Jeremiah 23:5-6 reveals the true deity of Jesus
by telling us that the title "the Lord our righteous-
ness" refers to Jesus Himself. (See also Psalm 45:6
-7; Hebrews 1:8-9.)

4 10. Malachi 2:10: "Have we not all one father?

hath not one God created us?" Isaiah 9:6 shows that
this One God and One Father is Jesus Himself.
Before becoming the Son He was the everlasting
Father, and He continues to be so even after His
manifestation. Moreover, God is not only the Father
of the heavenly man Christ, but also of all creation.
We are told in Malachi 2:10 and Isaiah 9:6 that we
have one everlasting Father and One Creator. God
is the same everlasting One before and after His
manifestation and His name is Jesus.

11. John 1:9-12: "That was the true Light, which
lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He
was in the world, and the world was made by him,
and the world knew him not. He came unto his own,
and his own received him not. But as many as
received him, to them gave he power to become the
sons of God, even to them that believe on his
name."

Jesus is the Light of the world who existed from
the very beginning. The world we see was created
by Him, and yet the world did not know Him. Our

57

God the Father and His Manifestation

Creator came in flesh to transform us into His
likeness and make us His children by the new birth.
He came into this world that we might have life
abundantly (John 10:10.).

According to John 1:13 the children of God are
"born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
the will of man, but of God." When we are baptized
in Jesus' name and filled with the Holy Ghost, we
are miraculously transformed into the likeness of
Christ; we put on His nature and become God's
children. As | Peter 1:23-25 says, "Being born again,
not of the corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by
the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.
For all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as
the flower of grass. The grass withered, and the
flower thereof falleth away: but the word of the Lord
endureth for ever." The living Word came in flesh in
order to transform us through the new birth and
enable us to become His sons.

12. Revelation 1:17-18: "And when | saw him, |
fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand
upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; | am the first
and the last: | am he that liveth, and was dead; and,
behold, | am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the
keys of hell and of death."

Jesus Christ is not only a man, born of Mary in
the fullness of time, but He is also Alpha and
Omega, the First and the Last. Just as He was born
Of Mary, He is also her Creator and Savior.

13. Zechariah 14:1-9: "Behold the day of the
LORD cometh .... And his feet shall stand in that day
upon the Mount of Olives .... And the LORD shall be
king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one
LORD, and his name one."

The God who is going to come to the earth at the
Second Advent and reign with His saints is Jesus.
In that day, the doctrine of the Trinity will be proven
false. Those who refused to believe that Jesus
Himself is the only God will be put to shame. Just as
Jesus Christ ascended to heaven, so He will come
again to earth in flesh to rule over all the world.

The Only Begotten Son of
God

Jesus Christ did not have two begetting or two
births. As God, He had no beginning; as heavenly
man He was born once as Son of God. (Matt.16:13-
17). "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1-4).
The Word was with the Father from eternity and was
the Father. The Father and Word are one and the
same. The Father Himself exists from eternity both
as Word and Spirit, and He continues to exist in the
same nature.

It is written in Psalm 2:1-7, "Why do the heathen
rage and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings
of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take
counsel together, against the LORD, and against his
anointed. . .The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my
Son, this day have? | begotten thee." Here God the
Father prophetically declared to the Messiah (Christ)
that He begot Him as His Son. Now when did the
heathen and rulers rise against the Messiah? It was
in the days of the New Testament. And it was after
Christ was born of Mary that God the Father testified
about His Son in Matthew 3:17, saying, "This is my
beloved Son, in whom | am well pleased."

60

<!-- Page 65 -->

The Identity of Jesus Christ

When Christ was transfigured, Moses and Elijah
were called to see the Son, whom they never met in
the days of the Old Testament. Overshadowed by a
cloud, they heard a voice say, "This is my beloved
Son: hear him" (Mark 9:2-8).

Many faiths teach that Christ preexisted
independently of God the Father as a second divine
person with the name "God the Son," begotten of
God the Father from eternity. This doctrine has no
scriptural support, since the Bible declares that there
is only one God from eternity. To begin with, God
never begets God, nor is God begotten of God. In
the Old Testament God manifested Himself to His
people in diverse ways, but always without changing
Himself.

God spoke through the prophets by prophecies
and promises that He would be revealed to His
people in the flesh. Accordingly, He came as the
Messiah born of Mary to save fallen humanity. The
word Messiah means “anointed one." When was
Christ anointed, and when was He sent? The
answer is, it occurred by the miraculous work of God
the Father when Christ was born of Mary. It is very
important to understand that the Messiah was the
Son of God only because of His birth from the Virgin
Mary. (See John 3:31-36; 6:31-63; 8:12-19, 23, 42; |
Corinthians 15:47-50; Hebrews 1:1-3.)

"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
with God, and the Word was God. . .And the Word
was made flesh" (John 1:1, 14). From this text we

61

---

<!-- Page 66 -->

The Only Begotten Son of God

learn that Word pre-existed only as God in the form
of Spirit, without any distinct figure. No one has
seen God, but He was manifested in form of man
(John 1:18).

Just as the word of a man can never be seen in
a separate form from the man himself, so was the
Word never seen existing as a separate person
independent of the one God. Nor can the Spirit of
God exist as a separate divine person independent
of the One God, just as the spirit of a man cannot.

But when the fulness of time came, God
prepared flesh in which to dwell. The statement "Let
us make man in our image, after our likeness" in
Genesis 1:26 actually remained a preconception
until God was manifested in the flesh.

Witnessing that His origin was heavenly and
eternal, Jesus said; "Verily, verily, | say unto you,
Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my
Father giveth you the ‘true bread from heaven, For
the bread of God is he which cometh down from
heaven, and giveth life unto the world. . .For | came
down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the
will of him that sent me." (John 6:32, 38). The Jews
were offended by His sayings and murmured among
themselves, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph,
whose father and mother we know? how is it then
that he saith, | came down from heaven? (John
6:42). Yet Jesus continued to assure them that He
was of heavenly origin and that His Sonship was
begotten by the eternal Spirit: "| am the living bread

which came down from heaven: if any man eat of
this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that |
will give is my flesh, which | will give for the life of the
world. . .As the living Father hath sent me, and |
live by the Father:-so he that eateth me even he
shall live by me, This is that bread which came down
from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and
are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for
ever" (John 6:51, 57-58).

In spite of all His attestations, the Pharisees
would not accept the divine origin of Jesus. They
said to him, "Thou bearest record of thyself; thy
record is not true" (John 8:13). At this point Jesus
answered, "Though | bear record of myself, yet my
record is true: for | know whence | came, and whither
| go; but ye cannot tell whence | come, and whither |
go... For! am not alone, but | and the Father that
sent me. . . If ye had known me. .. ye should have
known my Father also. .Ye are from beneath; | am
from above: ye are of this world; | am not of this
world" (John 8:14, 16, 19, 23).

When the Jews refused to believe that Christ
was the eternal God and came into this world as the
only begotten Son of God, Jesus said to them, "If
God were your Father, you would love me: for |
proceeded forth and came from God; neither came |
of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand
my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.
Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your
father ye will do" (John 8:42-44) .

The Only Begotten Son of God

Christ declared that He came into this world
as the Light: "I am come a light into the world, that
whosoever believeth on me should noi abide in
darkness. . .For | have not spoken of myself, but the
Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment,
what | should say, and what | should speak" (John
12:46, 49).

To repeat, Christ was originally the Word of
God, that is, God Himself. In the fulness of time He
came in flesh. As a man He was begotten of God
(not Joseph), and thus He proceeded from God. As
explained in John 13:3, He knew that He had come
from God and was to go to God.

Again Jesus witnessed about His divine origin in
John 16:28: "I came forth from the Father, and am
come into the world: again, | leave the world, and go
to the Father." To this statement His disciples
responded, "Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and
speakest no proverb" (John 16:29). As a result, they
believed that the Word, which was in God and was
God, was made flesh in Christ. Thus Christ testified
about his disciples, "Now they have known that all
things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. . .
.And have known surely that | came out from thee,
and they have believed that thou didst send
me" (John 17:7-8).

We must believe in Christ just as the apostles
did. We must be careful not to take the Word as a
second divine person, nor equate the Word with
"God the Son." What Jesus declared about Himself

64

The Identity of Jesus Christ

and what the disciples believed was that the Word
was made flesh, that God was manifested in the
flesh. :

As the Word or Spirit, Jesus Christ has no be-
ginning, but as flesh He had a beginning: "But thou,
Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the
thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come
forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose
going forth have been from of old, from everlasting.
Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she
which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant
of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.
And he shall stand and feed in the strength of LORD
in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God
and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto
the ends of the earth" (Micah 5:2-4). "God, who at
sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these
last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath
appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made
the worlds; who being the brightness of his glory,
and the express image of his person. . ." (Hebrews
4:1-3). In verse 2 the phrase "by whom also he made
the worlds" does not refer to the Son as a separate
eternal divine person. It rather indicates that the
Creator made the worlds with the Son in mind and in
dependence on His plan of redemption through the
Son.

We have established time and again that God
is only One. God cannot be considered (as many do)

ES

The Only Begotten Son of God

as three persons. The Word, the divine plan of
creation and redemption that was with God and was
God, was made flesh as the Son, and the Son made
God visible and tangible to human beings. That is
why the Apostle John wrote, “That which was from

the beginning, which we have heard, which we have .

seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and.
our hands have handled, of the Word of life; (for the
life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear
witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which
was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)
that which we have seen and heard declare we unto
you, that ye also. may ‘have fellowship with us: and

truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his

Son Jesus Christ" (1 John -1:1-3).

The Apostle . Paul described the origin of

Christ plainly as to His flesk and deity: "The first
Adam was made a living’ soul; the last Adam was

made a quickening spirit... . The first man is of the

earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from
heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that
are earthy: and as f& the heavenly, such are they

‘also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the
image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of
the heavenly" (I Corinthians 15:45, 47-49).

Hebrews elaborates on the heavenly origin of
Jesus Christ. Stressing that He should not be taken
merely as a descendant of the earthly Adam, it
gives the example of Melchizedek: "For this
Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high

66

The Identity of Jesus Christ

God, who met Abraham return-ing from the slaugh-
ter of the kings, and blessed him; to whom also
Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by
interpretation King of righteousness, and after that
also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; without
father, without mother, without descent, having
neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made
like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continu-
ally" (Hebrews 7:1-3).

The following passages of Scripture give us a
vivid picture of the deity and the body of Christ:
"Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing
for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God
also? Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a
sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a
son, and shall call his name Immanuel" (Isaiah 7:13-
14). "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
given and the government shall be upon his shoul-
der: and his name shall be called Wonderful,
Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father,
The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his govern-
ment and peace there shall be no end upon the
throne of David and upon his kingdom, to order it,
and to establish it with judgment and justice from
henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of
hosts will perform this" (Isaiah 9:6-7).

As a heavenly man Jesus was the promise son
of David and the heir to David’s throne, but He was
also David's Lord, as we read in Matthew 22:41-46:
"While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus

67

---

<!-- Page 72 -->

The Only Begotten Son of God

asked them, saying, What think ye of Christ? whose
son is he? They say unto him, The Son of David. He
saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call
him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit
thou on my right hand, till | make thine enemies thy
footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his
son? And no man was able to answer him a word."
As God Jesus is the root (creator) of David; as man
promised He is the offspring of David (Revelation
22:16).

Through the ages many people, starting with the
Pharisees, have been offended by statements of the
deity of Jesus such as, "The Word was made flesh
and dwelt among us," "| and my Father are one,"
"Before Abraham was, | am," and "I came forth from
the Father." Such people are described in | Peter 2:6
-8: "Behold, | lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect,
precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be
confounded. Unto you therefore which believe he is
precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the
stone which the builders disallowed, the same_is
made the head of the corner, and a stone of
stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which
stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto
also they were appointed."

John 17:3 says, "And this is life eternal, that they
might know thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ, whom thou hast sent." This verse teaches
that we must know the One true God and His
manifestation in flesh. The problem of most denomi-

nations is a failure to realize that God was
manifested in the flesh He prepared for Himself.
Most of them teach that Jesus is a second person of
the Godhead. Thus passages of Scripture such as
the ones we have quoted have been imaginatively
interpreted in different ways by different sects.
Some, for instance, have gone to the extent of
saying that Jesus is the archangel Michael.

Most groups in Christendom believe that God is
a trinity. They teach that a human son was prepared
by a divine "God the Son" in the womb of Mary. Thus
"God the Son" was incarnated in the child born of
Mary. They conclude that "God the Son" is co-
existing, co-equal, and co-eternal with God the Fa-
ther and "God the Holy Spirit," but that the human
son (Christ) suffered and died for the sins of the
world. They further believe that Christ was vulner-
able to weakness, sickness, and death, while such
attributes never apply to "God the Son."

A fifth-century theologian named Nestorius
emphasized the distinction between the deity and
humanity of Jesus Christ to such an extent that his
opponents accused him of teaching two distinct per-
sons of Christ and thus discarding the teaching of
the incarnation of "God the Son." One of his primary
concerns was to refute the teaching that Mary was
the mother of "God the Son." The result was a great
division in Christendom, which brought about perse-
cution and martyrdom. The opponents of Nestorius
taught not only that "God the Son" was incarnated in

69

<!-- Page 74 -->

The Only Begotten Son of God

the man born of Mary, but also proclaimed that Mary
was thereby the mother of God, and this teaching
encouraged the worship of Mary.

There also arose a man named Apollinaris who
taught that Jesus received a human body and soul
from Mary, but instead of a human spirit He had the
Spirit of God dwelling in him. Thus Jesus had an
incomplete human nature.

On the other hand, there were some who
stood against the teachings of the Trinity. One such
person was Sabellius. He taught that there are no
such things as three separate divine persons in the
Deity, but rather three manifestations or modes of
revelation of the one God.

The Bible teaches that there is only one God
and that He has revealed Himself as the Father, in
the Son, and as the Holy Ghost. Just as the word
and breath of a man cannot exist independently out-
side the man, so also the Word and Spirit of God
cannot be separate persons outside God the Father.

Moreover, the Bible firmly teaches that Jesus
Christis the Word of God, who was made flesh in
the womb of Mary by the miraculous work the Holy
Spirit. Jesus was truly heavenly man but He was
also the one God in flesh. As a man, He had an
earthly mother, Mary, but Biologically He did not
have an earthly father to apply seed for a Son to be
born. God Himself was the Father of the heavenly
flesh for the Son to be born. Thus Jesus was a

70

The Identity of Jesus Christ

genuine, perfect, sinless, heavenly man, and He was
- also the fulness of God in flesh.

Is there one Son of God or two? Trinitarianism
actually requires two:- one divine Son (the second
person in the Godhead), and one human Son, called
Christ. When we turn to the Bible, however, we find
that it does not speak of two Sons, but of only one:
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
should not perish, but have everlasting life” (John
3:6). “and Jesus, when he was baptized, went up”
straithway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens
were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God de-
scending upon him like a dove, and lighting upon him: and a
voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son,
in Whom | am well pleased" (Matthew 3:16-17).'

If there is only one Son of God, then who is that
Son? He is not a pre-existing second person of the
so-called Trinity, as many think; He is the Word
made flesh. The Son is the express image of the
deity, in whom God the Father was manifested. In
clear terms, the Son of God refers to the one God
manifested in the flesh. Colossians 2:8-9 says,
"Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy
and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the
rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in
him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily."

Trinitarian theologians teach that "God the Son"
was incarnated in the flesh. They should say God
the Father was incarnated in the flesh, for them the

71

---

<!-- Page 76 -->

The Only Begotten Son of God

Scriptures would support them. "For unto us a child
is born, unto us a son is given: and the government
shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The
everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace" (Isaiah
9:6). "For that which is conceived in her is of the
Holy Ghost. . .Behold, a virgin shall be with child,
and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his
name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God
with us" (Mat.1:20, 23). "And without controversy
great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest
in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels,
preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world,
received up into glory" (1Timothy 3:16). "Philip saith
unto him, Lord shew us the Father, and it sufficeth
us. Jesus saith unto him, Have | been so long iime
with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?
He that hath seen me hath seen the Father and how
sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? Believest
thou not that | am in the Father, and the Father in
me? The words that | speak unto you | speak not of
myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth
the works. Believe me that | am in the Father, and
the Father in me: or else believe me for the very
works’ sake” (John 14:8-11) .

For a thorough understanding of the manifes-
tation of God in the flesh, let us examine the Word of
God and the Spirit (breath) of God. First and
foremost, His Word and His Spirit are inseparable
from Him. For example, God uttered His Word, and

72

---

<!-- Page 77 -->

The Identity of Jesus Christ

there was suddenly created a huge universe. He
created many things great and small by uttering His
Word; He brought them all into existence out of noth-
ing by His Word (Hebrews 11:3). In creation is mani-
fested the power and wisdom of God. It follows then
that His Word by which He created the universe and
the things therein is His power and wisdom. And in
the fulness of time the Word became flesh in Christ.
Christ is the self-revelation of the Father in all His
power and wisdom, by which God does all things
(I Corinthians 1:24;Colossians 1:15-17; Heb.1:1-2).
Now that we have seen that the Word is the
self revelation of God's power and wisdom. Let us
turn to the Spirit of God. First of all, the Spirit of God
is God's breath, or God in life-giving operation. For
example, "the LORD God formed man of the dust of
the ground, and breathed into his nostril the breath
of life; and man became a living soul" (Genesis 2:7).
"The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of
the Almighty hath given me life" (Job 33:4). (See also
Job 32:8: Psalm 33:6.) From these passages of
Scripture we understand that the Spirit of God is the
one God exercising life-giving power. The Spirit
should not be considered as a third person of the
Godhead, for this concept is totally un scriptural.
Christ is the Word and Spirit of God in flesh (John
4:14; Luke 1:35). Since the One God (God the
Father) cannot be separated from His Word and
Spirit, God needed to manifested fully in Christ for

Christ to be the Word and Spirit of God. In other

73

<!-- Page 78 -->

The Only Begotten Son of God

words, since God cannot exist independently of His
Word and Spirit, He Himself was manifest in the
flesh. Therefore, in the flesh of Christ dwells all the
fulness of God.

As God the Father in flesh, Jesus Christ stated
the following:

"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day:
and he saw it, and was glad .... Verily, verily, |
say unto you, before Abraham was, | am" (John
8:56,58). (See also John 8:19, 24, 28.)

"Destroy this temple, and in three days | will
raise it up" (John 2:19). (See Acts 2:24: "Whom
God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of
death.")

"land my Father are one" (John 10:30).

“Have | been so long time with you, and yet
hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath
seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest
thou then, Shew us the Father?"(John 14:9-10).
"Son, thy sins be forgiven thee" (Mark 2:5).
"When the doors were shut where the disciples
were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Je-
sus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them,
Peace be unto you. . And when he had said
this, he breathed on themand saith unto them,
Receive ye the Holy Ghost" (John 20:19, 22).
"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but
he that came down from heaven, even the Son
of man which is in heaven" (John 3:13).

e "Jesus said unto her, | am the resurrection, and
the life: he that believeth in me, though he were
dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth
and believeth in me shall never die" (John
11:25-26).

These and many other passages of Scripture
attest to the authority of Christ as God the Father
manifested in the flesh. (See John 5:23; 12:45;
13:20; 15:23; | John 2:22-23.)

As to His body Jesus Christ stated the following:
e "He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my
blood, dwelleth in me, and | in him. As the living
Father hath sent me, and | live by the Father:
so he that eateth me, even he shall live by
me" (John 6:56-57).
"Behold, my hands and my feet, that it is |
myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not
flesh and bones, as ye see me have" (Luke
24:39).
"And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice,
he said, Father, into thy hands | commend my
spirit" (Luke 23:46).
"Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the
wilderness to be tempted of the devil. And when
he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was
after-ward an hungred. And when the tempter
came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God,
command that these stones be made bread. But
he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not

live by bread alone, but by every word that
proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matthew
4:1-4).

¢ "The Son of man came eating and drinking and
they say, Behold, a man gluttonous, and a
winebibber, a friend of publicans and_ sin-
ners" (Mathew 11:19) .

From the many verses quoted as well as the

explanations given above, we can conclude:-

1.

Jesus Christ, in His deity, is God the Father who
accompiished creation by his word. And by this
own breath, He gives life to creation. He has no
beginning He is the first and last, the Alpha and
Omega. Moreover, in His deity, Jesus rules the
universe and all therein with power, majesty and
justice in His deity (Read Psa. 33:5-6, Job 32:8,
Isa.9:6, Zechariah 14:9, Mal.2:10, John 1:1-14,
Isaiah 44: 6-8, Rev.22: 12-13).

. Jesus Christ, as the heavenly man, manifested
in flesh so as tc accomplish the plan of salvation
to humanity. In other words, He made His word
flesh (prepared a body-flesh, blood and bones)
and through this heavenly flesh, was visible to
humanity. According to Colossians 1:22, Jesus
Christ in the body of His flesh through death
(through the blood of His cross) redeemed hu-
manity (read John 1:14, 1Timothy 3:16, Hebrew
10:5, Hebrew 10:19-20, 1John 1:1-3, Romans
5:10, Col.1:21-22, 11Corinthians 5:19).

The Identity of Jesus Christ

The Bible gives Jesus many titles that attest to
His identity as the one God, as shown by the
following examples:
e Jesus Christ is the Lord of glory (I Corinth. 2:8).
e Jesus Christ is the Word (John 1:1,1,14;
Revelation 19:13) .

e Jesus Christ is the Holy One. (See Psalm
71:22: Isaiah 12:6; 41:16; 43:14; 47:4; 48:17;
Jeremiah 51:5; Ezekiel 39:7; Acts 3:14;
Revelation 3:7; 15:4.)

e Jesus Christ is the Rock of Salvation. (See
Deuteronomy 32:15-18; lISamuel = 22:2;
Psalm 18:2: 78:35, | Corinthians 10:4.)

The Sinless Heavenly man,
Is Christ

We have shown in the last chapters that the God-
man Christ was designed to be the dwelling or tem-
ple of God the Father. Hence, it was holy, not sinful
like the fallen Adamic nature.

Indeed, the heavenly man Christ was so holy that
He was prepared by the Father to take away the sin
of the world . John the Baptist was the first to pro-
claim among men, "Behold the Lamb of God, which
taketh away the sin of the world. This is he of whom
| said, After me cometh a man which is preferred be-
fore me: for he was before me: And | knew him not:
but that he should be made manifest to Israel, there-
fore am | come baptizing with water. . .But he that
sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto
me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descend-
ing, and remaining on him, the same is he which
baptizeth with the Holy Ghost" (John 1:29-31, 33).

Jesus testified of His Holiness and saving power
when He said, “As the living Father hath sent me,
and | live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even
he shall live by me" (John 6:57). No one can be

The Identity of Jesus Christ

saved by the flesh and blood of an ordinary person,
since everyone is a sinner. But since Christ was a
sinless man, begotten by the Spirit of God, He was
able to offer His flesh and blood as the atonement
for our sins.

Even before conception, the holiness of the flesh
of Christ was certified by the angel Gabriel. When
the Virgin Mary questioned, "How shall this be, see-
ing | know not a man?" the angel answered, "The
Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of
the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also
that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be
called the Son of God" (Luke 1:34-35).

The first (earthly) Adam was created from the
dust of the earth with God breathing by His Holy
Spirit upon the clay to make him a living soul
(Genesis 2:7). But the second (heavenly) Adam was
God manifest. He was a genuine Heavenly man, but
He did not partake of the earthly Adam's fallen, sinful
nature. He was the perfect and holy Son of God.
(See Matt.1:20-23; John 1:14; Hebrews 10:4-6, 10.)

As the holy Son of God, Jesus was raised from
the dead with power once and for all. "Concerning
his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was. . declared
to be the Son of God with power, according to the
spirit of holiness, by the resurrection of the
dead" (Romans 1:3-4). King David declared pro-
phetically, "For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell;
neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see
corruption" (Psalm 16:10).

‘The Sinless Heavenly Man is Christ

No one should dare say that Jesus Christ par-
took ofthe defiled, sinful nature. If even demons wit-
nessed His holiness, how much more should We? “And
there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean
spirit; and he cried out, saying, Let us alone; what have
we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou
come to destroy us? | know thee who thou art, the Holy
One of God" (Mark 1:23-24). (See also Luke 4:33-34.)

Let us summarize the holiness of the humanity
of Christ (the second Adam) with a table that compares
and contrasts Him with the first Adam and _ sinful
humanity.

Sinful Humanity Jesus Christ

4. Humanity can be the
temple of God, in-
dwelt by the Holy
Spirit (1 Corinthians

3:16).

Because of the first
Adam, sin entered
into the world along
with death. Both pass
from generation to
generation (Genesis
3; Rom. 5).

. Fallen humanity has a
will to sin and suc-
cumbs to temptations
(Romans 3:9-23; Gal.
5:16-21).

7. The first Adam's flesh
and blood is of no
avail for the atone-
ment of sins, since it
is sinful by nature
(Romans 3:23.
5:8-10).

8. Earthly priests had to
offer sacrifices for
their own sins _ first.
Their priesthood was
temporary because of
its weakness and un-
profitability
(Hebrews 7).

Christ's body is the temple
of God in that He Himself
was manifeste (John 2:20-
22: 14:8-10; Colossians
2:9).

Because of the second
Adam, righteousness and
eternal life have abounded
in the world (Genesis 3:15;
Romans 3:23-25; 5; 6:23;

Il Corinthians 5:17-21).

Christ submitted only to the
Father's will. He did not sin,
for He was holy by nature
(Matt. 4:1-10; John 5:19,
30; Heb.4:15).

Christ's flesh and blood is
perfect for the atonement of
sins (John 6:33-58;
Romans 3:25; 5:9-11).

Christ's priesthood is for-
ever, after the order of Mel-
chizedek, because He is
holy, undefiled, separated
from sin, and able to inter-
cede for humanity

Christ was predestined
to be the first-born Son

Christ and the Mystery of
Circumcision

The covenant of circumcision made between God
and Abraham in Genesis 17:1-14 was a shadow of the
eternal circumcision wrought through baptism of water
and Spirit as expounded in Galatians 3:15-29 and
Colossians 2:11-15. In establishing the covenant, God
said to Abraham, "Thou shalt keep my covenant there-
fore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.
. Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his
foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off
from his people; he hath broken my cove-
nant" (Gen.17:9,10, 14).

The New Testament application is given in Gala-
tians 3:16 “Now to Abraham and his seed were the
promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of
many; but as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed,
which is Christ." Thus God's promise to Abraham was
not only to his natural descendants, whose foreskins
were circumcised, but also to those who believe in
Christ, whose hearts are circumcised through water
baptism in His name and the baptism of His Spirit. Cir-
cumcision of the heart means putting on the nature of
Christ and becoming a new creation in Him.

84

The Identity of Jesus Christ

Christ died "that the blessing of Abraham might
come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we
might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith ....
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Je-
sus. For as many of you as have been baptized into
Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor
Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither
male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And
if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and
heirs according to the promise" (Gala. 3:14, 26-29).
In other words, God's covenant of circumcision with
Abraham has a twofold significance. The first, or
physical, fulfillment applied to Abraham's earthly de-
scendants who practiced circumcision of their fore-
skins. This rite of circumcision made Abraham's de-
scendants, the Israelites, a unique people chosen of
God. They were forbidden to mix with any other people
whatsoever in marriage or worship. As one people,
their heart was bound to Canaan, the promised land.
Despite their circumcision, however, they were stained
with sin. They had the inherent. Adamic nature and
had no power to overcome that nature of sin. They
longed for the promise of deliverance that God would
fulfill through Christ, and therefore they yearned for
coming of the Messiah.

The coming of Christ abolished the need for physi-
cal circumcision, which was merely a type, or foreshad-
owing, of a greater reality. It was replaced by spiritual
circumcision, which is for Jews and Gentiles alike and
which consists of putting off the sins of the old man
and put-ting on the nature of Christ through baptism in

The Mystery of Circumcision

Jesus' name and the baptism of the Holy Spirit. By this
experience people are transformed into anew, holy
generation.

The Bible describes this experience plainly. “In
whom [Christ] also ye are circumcised with the circum-
cision made without hands, in putting off the body of
the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: bur-
ied with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with
him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath
raised him from the dead. And you, being dead in your
sins, and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he
quickened together with him, having forgiven you all
trespasses; blotting out the handwriting of ordinances
that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took
it out of the way, nailing it to his cross" (Colossians
2:11-14). "Know ye not, that so many of us as were.
baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his
death? Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism
into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the
dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also
should walk in newness of life. For if we have been
planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall
be also in the likeness of his resurrection" (Romans
6:3-5).

The redemptive work of Jesus Christ also applies to
Old Testament saints (Romans 3:25). Although Abra-
ham did not and could not receive the full New Testa-
ment experience, he lived a repentant and obedient life
by faith, participating fully in the covenant of his day,
and he was thereby counted as righteous. Thus he
and the Old Testament saints will be resurrected,

transformed, and given eternal life in Jesus Christ.

The resurrection will be accomplished by Christ in
fulfillment of prophecy. "And in this mountain shall the
LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat
things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of
marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. And he will
destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast
over all people, and the vail that is spread over all na-
tions. He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord
GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the
rebuke of his peo-ple shall he take away from off all the
earth: for the LORD hath spoken it" (Isaiah 25:6-8).
"Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body
shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust:
for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall
cast out the dead" (Isaiah 26:19). "Verily, verily, | say
unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the
dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they
that hear shall live" (John 5:25).

The Apostle Peter explained the difference be-
tween the corruptible seed of Adam and the living seed
of Christ. (the second Adam), which we put on through
baptism In Jesus' name and the baptism of the Holy
Spirit: "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
incorrupt.ihl., by the Word of God, which liveth and abi-
deth for ever. For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory
of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and
the flower thereof falleth away: but the word of the Lord
endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the
gospel is preached unto you" (I Peter 1:23-25). (See
also Isaiah 40:1-11.) That is why we, like Peter, pro-

claim that no one today will be saved unless he is
. born again.

Before creation, God foreknew that mankind
would sin; thus He first predestined the holy nature of
Christ and the plan of redemption (| Peter 1:18-20).
Christ is the first-born Son of God. At the same time,
God predestined that people might be transformed into
the image of Christ, the first-born Son, through baptism
of water and Spirit, or the new birth, Paul attested to
this mystery, saying, "For whom he did foreknow, he
also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of
his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many
brethren" (Romans 8:29). Thus everyone who has put
on Christ has been given the privilege of becoming a
child of God. "According as he hath chosen us in him
before the foundation of the world, that we should be
holy and without blame before him in Itlye: having pre-
destinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure t If his
will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he
hath made us accepted in the beloved .... Having made
known unto us the mystery of his will, according 10 his
good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: that
in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might
gather together in one all things in Christ, both which
are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: in
whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being pre-
destinated according to the purpose of him who
worketh all things after the counsel of his own will: that
we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted
in Christ” (Ephesians 1:4-6, 9-12).

John 3:5-6 explains the new birth: "Jesus an-
swered, Verly, verily, | say unto thee, Except a man be
born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God. That which is born of flesh is flesh;
and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit.". This pas-
sage makes it plain that the old Adamic nature cannot
inherit the kingdom of God. We must put on Christ's
nature to become the spiritual sons of God.

In the resurrection, we shall receive a glorified
physical body like that of Christ. "For our conversation
is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour,
the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body,
that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, ac-
cording to the working whereby he is able even to a
due ail things unto himself" (Philippians 3:20-21). "For
we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle
were dissolved, we have a building of God [a glorified
body], an house not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens. For in this [the earthly, Adamic flesh] we
groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our
house which is from heaven" (il Corinthians 5:1-2).
(See also 1 Corinthians 5:3-17). ;

"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth
not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that,
when he shail appear, we shall be like him; for we shall
see him as he is" (I John 3:2).

Christ and the Mystery of
the Tabernacle

The Bible tells us that the Tabernacle of Moses was
a shadow of things to come. Let us brief-ly see how it
pointed to Jesus Christ.
The Tabernac'e had three parts:

1. The Outer Court

2. The Holy Place

3. The Most Holy Place

The outer court was where people came with their
satrifices to offer for the atonement of their sins. It was
the place of the altar of sacrifice and the laver of
washing.

The Holy Place and the Most Holy Place were situ- -
ated in She center of the court. These two rooms were
actual-ly one when viewed from the outer court, but a
veil inside divided them. The Holy Place contained the
table of holy bread, the altar of incense, and the golden
lampstand, while the Most Holy Place contained the
ark of the covenant. The Holy Place pointed to the re-
demptive role of Christ, who is our bread from heaven,
mediator, and light. The Most Holy Place represented
the presence of God Himself. The unity of the two
places shows how all the fullness of the Godhead
dwells bodily in Christ Jesus (Col.2:9) (Son and Father)
in the one person of Jesus Christ (John 2:19-22;14:6-10).

90

<!-- Page 95 -->

The Identity of Jesus Christ

The outer court represented atonement for sinners.
The priest took blood from the outer court, passed
through the Holy Place, and entered into the Most Holy
Place to sprinkle the blood over the ark, signifying that
no one can reach the Father but through Christ (John
10:1-18; 14:6-7; Il Corinthians 5:17-20; | Timothy 2:5-6;
Hebrews 7).

The ark of the covenant contained the tables of
stone on which were written the Ten Commandments
of God, including the name of God. The ark and the
tables of stone can be seen depicting the one God
manifested in the flesh. If we compare the ark to body
of Jesus and the name and Word of God inscribed on
the tables of stone God the father manifested, then we
have a picture of the manifestation— the Father in
Christ, the Word made flesh.

After Moses put the tables of stone in the ark, no-
body was able to see them. Nevertheless God worked
mightily by His name among His people in the Old Tes-
tament days. Likewise, in the New Testament the in-
visible God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Him-
self (John 5:43; 11 Corinthians 5:19). That is why Christ
was called Emmanuel, or "God with us" (Isaiah 7:13-
14; Matthew 1:23). And since Christ is Emmanuel, He
is the mighty God and the everlasting Father (Isaiah
9:6).

Isaiah 40:5 declares, "And the glory of the LORD
shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together." for
the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it." According to
Hebrews 1:3, Christ is the glory of God. Through the
body of Christ, then, people have seen the Father. In

The Mystery of the Tabernacle

Christ is the ultimate fulfillment of God's covenant of
His manifestation: "And | will set my tabernacle among
you: and my soul shall‘not abhor you. And | will walk
among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my
people" (Leviticus 26:11-12). (See also Rev. 21:3-4.)

The glory of God that was in the ark of the cove-
nant and the Tabernacle at large is now vividly mani-
fested in the everlasting dwelling or temple of God, that
is, the flesh of Christ. The Word of God, represented by
the tables of stone, was made flesh in Christ, and
Christ dwells in the hearts of believers today by the
Holy Spirit. Thus is Ezekiel 36:26-27 fulfilled: "A new
heart also will | give you and a new spirit will | put
within you: and | will take away the stony heart out of
your flesh, and | will give you a heart of flesh. And | will
put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do
them."

The Apostle Paul explained how the prophecy of
Ezekiel is fulfilled in our lives: "Forasmuch as ye are
manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ minis-
tered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of
the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshly ta-
bles of the heart. And such trust have we through
Christ to God-ward. . .who also hath made us able
ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of
the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in
stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel
could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the
glory of his counténance; which glory was to be done

92

The Identity of Jesus Christ

away: how shall not the ministration of the spirit be
rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation
be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteous-
ness exceed in glory. . And not as Moses, which put a
vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not
stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: but
their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth
the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old
testament; which vail is done away in Christ. . Never-
theless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be
taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the
Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all, with
open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,
are changed into the same image from glory to glory,
even as by the Spirit of the Lord" (Il Corinthians 3:3-4,
6-9, 13-14, 16-18).

The tables of stone were prepared by God; He _
wrote the words by His own fingers. Likewise, the map
Christ was prepared by God as the cornerstone of Zion
-the flesh prepared by God for the salvation of sinners.
"Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold,
I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and
he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. . .
The stone which the builders disallowed, the same is
made the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling,
and a rock of offense, to them which stumble at the
word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were ap-
pointed" (| Peter 2:6-8),

Moses broke the tables of stone engraved and
given to him by God. He did so when he saw the un-
godly, sinful acts of the Israelites. Likewise, Christ-the

eee

The Mystery of the Tabernacle

corner stone that was prepared of God and given to this
ungodly, sin-stained world-was despised and broken
on the cross.

The Israelites were victorious over all the power of
the enemy whenever they turned to the Lord and en-
camped around the ark of the covenant, for the Lord
manifested His presence there and guided them to vic-
tory. In the same way, when God did away with the old
covenant and entered into a new covenant with His
people, He revealed Himself and His eternal name in
Christ. Thus Christ was made the cornerstone of the
church, which is His spiritual body. As a result, the
church is exceedingly victorious over death, hell, and
all demonic powers in the name of Jesus. The Taber-
nacle of Moses, therefore, has been replaced in the
New Testament by the church of Christ. "For ye are the
temple of the living God as God hath said, | will dwell in
them, and walk in them: and | will be their God, and
they shall be my people. Wherefore, come out from
among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and
touch not the unclean thing; and | will receive you, and
will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
daughters, saith the Lord Almighty’ (II Corinthians
6:16-18), (See also | Corinthians 3:16-17, 6:19-20.)

Christ the Mediator Between
Man and God

Isaiah 59:16-17 is a prophecy about the mediatorial
work of Christ as God manifest: "And he saw that there
was no man, and wondered that there was no interces-
sor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and
his righteousness, it sustained him. For he put on right-
eousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation
upon his head; and he put on the garments of venge-
ance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke."

The arm of God means the power of God, and
every Christian knows that Jesus Christ is the power
and wisdom of God (I Corinthians 1:24).

Because of the transgression of Adam and Eve,
sin came into the earth, thus there was an urgent need
for a power that would be able to take away eternal
death—the wages of sin-and give to humanity eternal
life instead. The power of sin separated people far from
God. There stood a veil between God and humanity as
a result, and no earthly power could take away the veil
and reconcile humanity to God. Since the righteous-
ness of a human being was as "filthy rags," there was
no human worthy to reconcile mankind to God. There-
fore, God's own arm brought reconciliation between
humanity and God. The arm of God was God Himself
coming in the flesh.

The Identity of Jesus Christ

Isaiah spoke of this mediator in Isaiah 53:1-6:
"Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the
arm of the LORD revealed? For he shall grow up be-
fore him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry
ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we
shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire
him. He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sor-
rows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were
our faces from him; ho was despised, and we es-
teemed him not. Surely, he hath borne our griefs, and
carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken,
smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for
our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities:
the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with
his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone
astray; we have turned everyone to his own way; and
the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.”

In another place the same prophet revealed that
this mediator would be God manifest in the flesh: "For
unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given: and the
government shallbe upon his shoulder: and his name
shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God,
The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace" (Isaiah
9:6). The title "Prince of Peace" discloses that He
came to the world to make peace between God and
humanity as a mediator. Since He is the Son of God,
He is able and has power to reconcile Us to God. As
the Bible declares, "Behold my servant, whom | have
chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased:
| will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall shew judg-
ment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive, nor cry;

96

Christ the Mediator

neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets. A
bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall
he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.
And in his name shall the Gentiles trust" (Matthew
12:18-21). Through His atoning death, He makes inter-
cession unto salvation: "Wherefore he is able also to
save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him,
seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for
them" (Hebrews 7:25).

The Old Testament priests were sinful men and
daily needed to offer up sacrifices, first for their own
sins and then for the people's. Their priesthood was
only tem-porary because of sin and death. But the
New Testament high priest-Jesus Christ-was sinless,
holy, and separate from sinners. He did not need to
offer up sacrifices any sins of His own. Rather, He of-
fered himself up once for all so that sinners can be
cleansed by His blood and can come to God through
His priesthood. Christ's priesthood was established
eternally with an oath, for He is without sin, eternal,
and unchangeable.

Through Christ's sacrifice we can receive forgive-
ness of sins. "My little children, these things write |
unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have
an advocate with the father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
and he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours
only, but also for the sins of the whole world" (| John
2:1-2). Indeed, everyone who makes the Son of God
His advocate has eternal life. But those who do not
have the Son of God do not have God the Father ei-
ther, and so do not have eternal life (1 John 5:12-13).

The Identity of Jesus Christ

Believers are united into one body, the church, by
the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. "For he is our
peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken
down the middle wall of partition between us; having
abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of com-
mandments contained in ordinances; for to make in
himself of twain one new man, so making peace; and
that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by
the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: and came
and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to
them that were nigh. For through him we both have ac-
cess by one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore ye
are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citi-
zens with the saints, and of ‘the household of
God" (Ephesians 2:14-19). Because of the mediation
of His only begotten Son, we have access to the
Father.

The mediation of Jesus Christ should not be taken
lightly; we were so sin-stained and separated from God
that there could never be any reconciling power except
by a sinless man who proceeded from God-Jesus
Christ, the only begotten Son of God. "As by one man
sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so
death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. . .
And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for
-the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free
gift is of many offenses unto justification. For if by one
man's offense death reigned by one; much more they
which receive abun-dance of grace and of the gift of
righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus
Christ" (Rom.5:12, 16-17).

Christ the Mediator

When we fully understand the holiness of Christ
and that he partakes of the nature of the Father, we
feel confident that His blood blots out our sins and we
fearlessly come into the presence of the Father. Thus
we become a new creation after the likeness of His
Son. "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new
creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things
are become new. And all things are of God, who hath
reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath
given to us the ministry of reconciliation; to wit, that
God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself,
not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
committed unto us the word of  recon-
ciliation" (IICorinthians5:17-19).

Those of us who are baptized in Jesus' name and
filled with the Holy Ghost have put on Christ and have
been regenerated. (See John 3:5; | Cor. 12:13; Gala-
tians 3:27.) Thus we have no condemnation (Romans
8:1). "Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's
elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that con-
demneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen
again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also
maketh intercession for us" (Rom.8:33-34).

The redemptive work of Jesus Christ in this
world for us-His sufferings, humiliation, poverty, agony,
lamentations, pains, and shedding of His precious
blood, culminating in His death, burial, resurrection,
and ascension-has made salvation and eternal life
available to all humanity.

The Name of the Deity is One

God is interested in giving names to Himself and
his creatures alike. He said in Genesis 17:5, "Neither
shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy
name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations
have | made thee." Likewise He named Jacob Israel
(Genesis 32:28).

All names given by God in the Bible carry purpose-
ful meanings. In particular, He has given names to
Himself with purposeful meanings. For example, in the
Old Testament days God introduced Himself to people
at different times with the Hebrew names Elohim
(translated in the English Bible as God) and El Shaddai
(Genesis 17: 1) (translated in English asthe Almighty
God). Jehovah was His identifying name in the Old
Testament, and it carries the connotation of "the One
who causes to be" (Exodus 6:3). According to Jewish
history, the Jews feared to address God by the name
Jehovah lest they dishonor His sacred name, so they
preferred to call Him Adonai, meaning "Lord."

In Old Testament days, God also had com-
pound titles or names, such as the following:
1.Jehovah-Jireh ("The LORD will © provide")
(Genesis 22:14)

2. Jehovah-Rapha ("The LORD that heals")
(Exodus 15:26)

3. Jehovah-Nissi ("The LORD our victory")
(Exodus 17:15)

4. Jehovah-Shalom ("The LORD our peace")
(Judges 6:24)

5. Jehovah-Raah ("The LORD my shepherd")
(Psalm 23:1)

6. Jehovah-Tsidkenu ("The LORD our righteous-
ness") (Jeremiah 23:6)

7. Jehovah-Shammah ("The LORD is present")
(Ezekiel 48:35)

God was interested in giving names to Himself by
which he could communicate with mankind, reveal His
character, and show His power. Moreover, people in
the Bible gave so much importance to the name of
God that they asked for His name when He appeared
to them. Here are some examples: "And Jacob asked
him, and said, Tell me, | pray thee, thy name" (Genesis
32:29). "And Moses said unto God, Behold, when |
come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto
them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you,
and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall
| say unto them?" (Exodus 3:13). "Who hath estab-
lished all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and
what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?" (Proverbs
30:4).

In the Old Testament, as we have seen, the names
God given to people at different times revealed His
personality, power, omnipresence, righteousness, holi-

ness, goodness, and other aspects of His character
and nature. However, none of the names in the Old
Testament is a complete revelation of God's nature.
For example, each of the compound names was
merely a title designed to fulfill a certain purpose or
meet a certain need at a particular time. Therefore,
when God's people needed victory, they called on the
name Jehovah-Nissi. When they needed healing from
their infirmities, they called on the name Jehovah-
Rapha. When Israe! needed deliverance from the
Pharaoh they called on the name Jehovah, the name
particularly associated with deliverance (Exodus 6:3-7).

God was yet to reveal His name of salvation, and
this He did in the New Testament. However, the proph-
ecy about the revelation of this great name started in
the Old Testament. "Therefore my people shall know
my name: therefore they shall know in that day that |
am he that doth speak: behold, it is I" (Isaiah 52:6).
And this name God's people should know was
revealed at the time of the birth of the Son of God in
the New Testament: "Behold, the angel of the Lord ap-
peared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son
of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for
that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And
she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
JESUS: for he shall save his people from their
sins" (Matthew 1:20-21).

The name of Jesus was described in the Old Tes-
tament as Jehovah-Tsidkenu, as we read in Jeremiah
23:5-6: "Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that |
will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King

shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment
and justice in the earth. In his days Judah shall be
saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his
name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR
RIGHTEOUSNESS [Jehovah-Tsidkenu]." The name
Jesus actually means "Jehovah our Savior" or
"Jehovah our Salvation." Therefore, Jesus is the New
Testament name of Jehovah, or God the Father.

The following verses of Scripture assure us that the
name Jesus is the name of God the Father Himself in
His manifestation in His Son:

e "lam come in my Father's name" (John 5:43).
e "I have manifested thy name unto the men which

thou gavest me out of the world" (John 17:6) .

e "While | was with them in the world, | kept them in

thy name" (John 17:12).

e "And | have declared. unto them thy name, and will

declare it" (John 17:26).

Matthew 1:20-23 reveals that the name of Em-
manuel is Jesus: "For that which is conceived in her is
of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and
thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his
people from their sins. Now all this was done, that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the
prophet, saying, Behold a virgin shall be with child, and
shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Em-
manuel, which being interpreted is, God with us." Thus
the singular, redemptive name in Matthew 28:19 that
reveals the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost is Jesus.

Zechariah of old prophesied, "And the LORD shall
be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one,

103

The Name of the Deity is One

LORD, and his name one" (Zechariah 14:9). Thus
-when God established the new covenant, He began to
reign and work by His supreme redemptive name, the
name by which He will be known throughout eternity-
Jesus. The following passages of Scripture demon-
strate this truth:-

e "But when they believed Philip preaching the
things concerning the kingdom of God, and the
name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both
men and women. . .They were baptized in the
name of the Lord Jesus" (Acts 8:12, 16).

e "And that repentance and remission of sins
should be preached in his name among all
nations beginning at Jerusalem'(Luke 24:47).

e "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there

“is none other name under heaven given among
men whereby we must be saved" (Acts 4:12), '

¢ "And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in
the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God
and the Father by him" (Colossians 3:17),

"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be
baptized everyone of you in the name |of Jesus Christ
for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of
the Holy Ghost" (Acts 2:38). (SeealsoActs10:43-
48;19:1-6,22:16;1 Cor.6:11.) \

Jesus is the culmination of all the titles and
names of God in the Old Testament. The name Jesus
encompasses all the other names of God within its
meaning. This name is higher than all other names and
powers, and subdues all principalities. The name
Jesus is the most exalted name of God. By the name

of Jesus everyone has the right to become a child of
God (John 1:12). But everyone who refuses to believe
in this saving and almighty name of Godwill on the
judgment day kneel down to this name in subjection.
"Wherefore God also hath highly exalted given him a
name which is above every name: that at the name of
Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and
things in earth, and things under the earth, and that
every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father" (Philip.2:9-11). This
name is "far above all principality, and power, and
might, and dominion, and every name that is named,
not only in this world, but also in that which is to come;
and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to
be the head over all things to the church, which is his
body, the fullness of him that filleth all in
all" (Ephessians1:21-23).

The various titles used with reference to God in the
New Testament: Father, Son, Holy Ghost, Christ
(Messiah), Emmanuel, Alpha and Omega, Word, and
sO on-are not given for salvation, healing, or deliver-
ance. Rather they designate various roles, attributes,
relations, or offices of God and have their own mean-
ings. For example, Father is not a name, nor are Son
and Holy Ghost. "Father" shows that God is the Crea-
tor and source of everything. "Son" refers to the flesh
begotten as the perfect manifestation of deity. "Holy
Ghost" shows that God is holy and Spirit. That is why
the Apostle Peter, fully guided by the Spirit and sup-
ported by the rest of the apostles, commanded people
to be baptized in Jesus' name instead of in the titles

105

Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. In fact, Jesus Himself
commanded His disciples to baptize in the name
(singular), not names, of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost. This one name in which people should be bap-
tized was proclaimed by the apostles to be the name
Jesus (Acts 2:38).

Micah 5:2-4 states, "Thou, Bethlehem Ephratah. . .
out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be
ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of
old, from everlasting. Therefore will he give them up,
until the time that she which travaileth hath brought
forth: . . And he shall stand and feed in the strength of
the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his
God." This prophecy was fulfilled when God was mani-
fested in the flesh bearing the only saving name, Je-
sus. That is why Christ Himself taught that there is only
one name of the Father that should be hallowed: "Our
Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy
name" (Matthew 6:9). He also urged His disciples to
ask anything in the name of Jesus that their joy might
be complete: "Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in
my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked
nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that
your joy may be full" (John 16:23-24).

After opening the minds of the disciples to the
knowledge of the Scripture, Jesus said to them,
"Repentance and remission of sins should be
preached in his name among all nations beginning at
Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these
things" (Luke 24:47-48). With these words, He told the
disciples to proclaim the name of Jesus.

When Peter was preaching salvation in the name of
Jesus to Cornelius and his family, he said to them, "To
him give all the prophets witness, that through his
name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remis-
sion of sin" (Acts 10:43).

Even after Christ's ascension, when God ap-
peared to men such as Paul He revealed Himself by
the name of Jesus (Acts 9:5). And finally, according to
Zechariah 14:1-9, when God comes to judge the
world, He will be revealed by the unique, supreme,
glorious, and everlasting name-Jesus!
